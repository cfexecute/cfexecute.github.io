Graham Humphreys' career as a poster artist looms large over horror cinema. From designing the iconicÂ Evil DeadÂ poster to Nightmare on Elm Street and House of a Thousand Corpses, his work is familiar to everyone. It's easy to see why his work grabs the attention of horror fans and filmmakers alike as he continually and systematically sets the bar ever higher in his quest for sheer terror and pure entertainment. With more than 40 years experience he is one of the few contemporary illustrators using the traditional medium of gouache to paint his images. Includes previously unseen work: paintings, drawings, and color studies.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Graham immediately understood the essence of our film and painted an image that ripped up the traditions and threw the movie right in your face. I loved this poster!" --Sam Raimi, director, producer, screenwriter, actor<BR><BR>"Graham Humphreys' art is at once beautiful and transformative." --Clive Barker, screenwriter and novelist<BR><BR>"I've long been an admirer of Graham's wonderful artwork. For me, there's nothing that quite says HORROR like the queasy, lurid phantasms he conjures up with such wit, skill and imagination. I think I found The Evil Dead poster scarier than the film!" --Mark Gatiss, actor, screenwriter and novelist<BR><BR>"How do I love Graham Humphreys's artistry? Let me count the ways.Â The genre of horror, because of its examination of things dark and strange, demands a certain theatricality inÂ approach. And capturing the spirit and tone of a horror film in a single image such as a poster or DVD cover isÂ especially challenging. Time and again Graham's masterful art work meets and exceeds that challenge. HisÂ illustrations are consistently vivid, energetic and always convey an uncanny sense of motion and emotion. GrahamÂ Humphreys is at the pinnacle of his craft and I am so honored to have been the subject of a number of his." --Jeffrey Combs, author, Re-Animator<BR><BR>"One hundred seventy-six pages of iconic movie posters, illustrations and paintings . . . every work here deserves close inspection, and any fans of classic horror and sci-fi art will find loads to love. It's also great to see a contemporary artist resisting digital image creation and using the traditional medium of gouache to paint his images."Â  -This is Cool<BR>Â <BR><BR>"Not only does this book showcase Graham's amazing body of work, it includes a step-by-step breakdown of his painting process, which makes it invaluable to any budding artist." --Wolfbait<BR><BR>"With his distinctive but always innovative style, Humphreys could quite comfortably be termed the British Drew Struzan. This is a beautifully-presented testament to his art and is an essential purchase for any genre fan." --Starburst<BR><BR>"Hung, Drawn and Executed is a fascinating and delightful peek behind the curtain of all too often woefully ignored facet of one of the world's most beloved genres." -- Mass Movement<BR><BR>"For over forty years Graham Humphreys has been a fixture on the UK horror scene as an artist and designer. Hung, Drawn, and Executed is a wonderful introduction to Humphreys' signature colourful style that is both instantly recognizable and utterly stunning." --Screen Anarchy<BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Graham HumphreysÂ is an illustrator and visual artist best known for producing film posters. During the 1980s, Humphreys worked with Palace Pictures, producing publicity material for such films asÂ Dream Demon,Â Basket Case,Â The Evil Dead, andÂ Nightmare on Elm Street. His current projects include vinyl LP sleeves, posters, private commissions, and work for horror film festivals.<BR><BR>Foreword by Dacre StokerÂ <BR>Dacre Stoker is the great-grandnephew of Bram Stoker and the international bestselling co-author ofÂ Dracula: The Un-DeadÂ (2009), the official Stoker family-endorsed sequel toÂ DraculaÂ and the prequelÂ DraculÂ (2018).

A PRESIDENT ON TRIAL. A REPUTATION AT STAKE.<BR><BR>"Remarkable and intensely dramatic." -SCOTT TUROW<BR><BR>"A fascinating window onto the former President." -BRIAN KILMEADE<BR><BR>ABC News legal correspondent and host of LIVE PD Dan Abrams reveals the story of Teddy Roosevelt's last stand-an epic courtroom battle against corruption-in this thrilling follow-up to the New York Times bestseller Lincoln's Last Trial.<BR><BR>"No more dramatic courtroom scene has ever been enacted," reported the Syracuse Herald on May 22, 1915 as it covered "the greatest libel suit in history," a battle fought between former President Theodore Roosevelt and the leader of the Republican party. <BR><BR>Roosevelt , the boisterous and mostly beloved legendary American hero, had accused his former friend and ally, now turned rival, William Barnes of political corruption. The furious Barnes responded by suing Roosevelt for an enormous sum that could have financially devastated him. The spectacle of Roosevelt defending himself in a lawsuit captured the imagination of the nation, and more than fifty newspapers sent reporters to cover the trial. Accounts from inside and outside the courtroom combined with excerpts from the trial transcript give us Roosevelt in his own words and serve as the heart of Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense.<BR><BR>This was Roosevelt's final fight to defend his political legacy, and perhaps regain his fading stature. He spent more than a week on the witness stand, revealing hidden secrets of the American political system, and then endured a merciless cross-examination. Witnesses including a young Franklin D. Roosevelt and a host of well-known political leaders were questioned by two of the most brilliant attorneys in the country. <BR><BR>Following the case through court transcripts, news reports, and other primary sources, Dan Abrams and David Fisher present a high-definition picture of the American legal system in a nation standing on the precipice of the Great War, with its former president fighting for the ideals he held dear.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>05/13/2019<BR><BR>Abrams, chief of legal affairs for ABC News, and Fisher follow up Lincoln's Last Trial with another intriguing presidential courtroom procedural. This one is centered on a highly public 1914 libel claim brought by a New York state politician, William Barnes, against former president Teddy Roosevelt. Roosevelt had written that Barnes, a key player in the New York Republican machine, was corrupt and that his actions "deeply taint and discredit our whole government system." Working with the transcript of the case, Abrams and Fisher dissect the legal maneuvering from jury selection to direct and cross-examination of the parties, witnesses called, judicial rulings, closing arguments, and the jury verdict. They provide insightful commentary on how the opposing lawyers, William Ivins for Barnes and John Bowers for Roosevelt, employed sophisticated courtroom strategies, tricks, and diversions, smartly deconstructing Ivins's strategy of offering constant objections to Bowers's examination of Roosevelt and Bowers's skillful cross-examination of Barnes, which undercut small parts of earlier testimony. Many of the questions the trial raised about the effects of money in politics, the dangers of blind allegiance to party politics, and oversize corporate political influence will resonate with contemporary readers. Legal eagles and history buffs will enjoy this one. Agent: Frank Weimann, Folio. (May) - Publishers Weekly<BR><BR>Praise for Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense<BR><BR>"This beautifully-wrought story of Theodore Roosevelt's defense of his claims of corruption in New York State politics has intense echoes today. Abrams and Fisher do a superb job of clearly presenting the issues in this remarkable and intensely dramatic trial." --SCOTT TUROW<BR><BR>"Growing up on Long Island just miles from Teddy Roosevelt's historic home I thought I knew just about everything about our 26th President. I was wrong. Using Roosevelt's eight days of testimony, Dan Abrams and David Fisher present a fascinating window onto the former President Roosevelt that is fresh and often surprising. This trial and Roosevelt's defense of his reputation on the stand, often under fierce questioning, is truly mesmerizing." --BRIAN KILMEADE<BR><BR>"Maintaining suspense about the jury's verdict, Abrams and Fisher deliver a fine and timely legal drama." --Booklist<BR><BR>"Many of the questions the trial raised about the effects of money in politics, the dangers of blind allegiance to party politics, and oversize corporate political influence will resonate with contemporary readers. Legal eagles and history buffs will enjoy this one." --Publishers Weekly<BR><BR>"A feisty Roosevelt takes center stage." --Kirkus Reviews<BR><BR>"Dan Abrams and David Fisher have penned a thrilling account of a nationally important trial that had profound consequences for both parties, one of whom happened to be Teddy Roosevelt. Abrams and Fisher have sifted through the archives to give us a courtroom seat to witness T.R. at his "bully" best in this high stakes, high drama, high profile, yet so far relatively unknown, trial from our nation's history." --GREGG TRIPOLI, Executive Director, Onondaga Historical Association <BR><BR>PRAISE FOR LINCOLN'S LAST TRIAL<BR><BR>"Dan Abrams and David Fisher write the heart-pounding pulse of history. Abraham Lincoln: the dusty shoes, the weary eyes, the Jedi mastery of a jury in a true case of life and death. So pull up a chair. This book not only brings a rare transcript to life, it makes you feel as if you are watching a live camera riveted on a courtroom more than 150 years ago."--Diane Sawyer<BR><BR>"You didn't know that Abraham Lincoln was the defense lawyer in a notorious murder case on the eve of his presidency? Neither did I. But Dan Abrams and David Fisher tell the remarkable tale in Lincoln's Last Trial, and the story is both compelling on its own terms and a lesson about some eternal truths about criminal justice."--Jeffrey Toobin, author of American Heiress<BR><BR>"We all know the story of Abraham Lincoln the wartime president, the defender of the Union, and the emancipator of the slaves. But Abraham Lincoln, the defense lawyer? Dan Abrams and David Fisher recount the engaging story of Lincoln's last trial, occurring on the cusp of the Civil War. An entertaining book filled with twists and turns and tailor-made for Civil War buffs."--Jay Winik, author of April 1865 and 1944<BR><BR>"Lincoln's wartime leadership overshadows his life as a lawyer. But you can't understand one without the other. In this rich and previously unexplored corner of history, the authors take you inside the courtroom to watch Abraham Lincoln - at the height of his powers as a lawyer and on the edge of eternal fame - as he tries a thrilling murder trial to a jury."--Chris DeRose, New York Times bestselling author of The Presidents' War,Congressman Lincoln, and Founding Rivals<BR><BR>"Abraham Lincoln was involved in thousands of cases in his distinguished legal career, few more intriguing than the 1859 murder trial of 'Peachy' Quinn Harrison... Abrams and Fisher adeptly place the Harrison trial within the context of Lincoln's legal career and his well-known skills before a jury. " -Kirkus Reviews<BR><BR>"The authors give readers a moment-by-moment account of the murder trial, which featured a well-liked young victim, a claim of self-defense, [and] a deathbed admission... Lincoln enthusiasts will find the illumination of his preternatural legal skills a worthy subject; casual readers will find the centerpiece murder trial an engrossing legal thriller."--Publishers Weekly<BR><BR>"Legal affairs journalist Abrams and coauthor Fisher illuminate a key marker on Abraham Lincoln's path to the White House... The transcripts reveal Lincoln at his best, fighting for a cause he believed in with brilliance and passion--qualities that would serve him so well as president."--Booklist<BR><BR>"Abrams and Fisher quote generously from Hitt's transcript to bring into sharp focus the witness-by-witness testimony and courtroom proceedings."--Library Journal<BR><BR>"Dan Abrams tells the story of Lincoln's last trial as an immersive true crime and courtroom drama experience, with impeccable research and highly entertaining digressions on such topics as 19th century jury selection."--Crimereads<BR><BR>"[The case] cemented Lincoln's image as a courtroom star--and Abrams and Fisher have made the most of their material, polishing a musty transcript into an entertaining slice of life."--USA Today<BR><BR>"His last great legal case." --New York Post<BR><BR>"Many aspects of the Harrison trial made it spellbinding and important. ... [Lincoln's Last Trial] adds a new layer of understanding about how Lincoln's mind worked as a consummate trial lawyer, and how that mind provided the platform for his political prowess." --Washington Independent Review of Books<BR><BR>"A vivid portrait of Lincoln, other attorneys, what happened in the tragic case and the era. ... Lincoln's Last Trial may represent his last major case as an attorney but hopefully it is just the beginning of a series of history books from Abrams and Fisher." --Valdosta Daily Times - From the Publisher<BR><BR>12/01/2018<BR><BR>What happened when former president Theodore Roosevelt accused Republican Party leader William Barnes of corruption, who then sued? From the authors of the New York Times best-selling Lincoln's Last Trial; with a 300,000-copy first printing. - Library Journal<BR><BR>2019-03-17<BR>An account of a much-publicized early-20th-century trial that exposed "the sordid reality" of New York State politics.<BR><BR>In April 1915, eager spectators filled a Syracuse courtroom in anticipation of a trial involving one of the most prominent men in America: former President Theodore Roosevelt, who was being sued for libel by party boss William Barnes over Roosevelt's published assertion that Barnes was corrupt. The trial yielded a 3,738-page typed transcript as well as colorful reports in newspapers across the country, sources that ABC's chief legal affairs correspondent Abrams and Fisher (co-authors: Lincoln's Last Trial: The Murder Case that Propelled Him to the Presidency, 2018, etc.) have mined thoroughly to produce a detailed--sometimes dramatic, sometimes humdrum--account of the drama. The abundant sources prove to be both a boon and a shortcoming: Not all of the 104 witnesses who testified during the trial were compelling; nor were some issues--such as Barnes' "alleged involvement in printing industry corruption," which occupied the court for many days. The highlight of the trial--and of this book--was the week that Roosevelt, "an explosion of energy," took the stand. As the New York Press reported, Roosevelt dominated the courtroom "with that marvelous personality of his and has won more friends in Syracuse than he made at any particular time." After more than 38 hours of questioning, heckled by the plaintiff's lawyers, who tried to goad him into anger, he emerged "smiling and happy and ready for more," stepping down from the stand and grinning at the jury. The trial was not the only news: War was brewing in Europe, and President Woodrow Wilson strained to keep America out of the fray. Roosevelt strongly urged engagement, a stand that worried his lawyers, who were fearful of alienating several jurors of German descent. Roosevelt held back from criticizing Germany--until the sinking of the Lusitania, "piracy accompanied by murder," he said, impelled him to urge America's immediate entry into the war.<BR><BR>A feisty Roosevelt takes center stage in a mostly lively history. - Kirkus Reviews

For readers of The Astronaut Wives Club, The Mercury 13 reveals the little-known true story of the remarkable women who trained for NASA space flight.<BR><BR>In 1961, just as NASA launched its first man into space, a group of women underwent secret testing in the hopes of becoming America's first female astronauts. They passed the same battery of tests at the legendary Lovelace Foundation as did the Mercury 7 astronauts, but they were summarily dismissed by the boys' club at NASA and on Capitol Hill. The USSR sent its first woman into space in 1963; the United States did not follow suit for another twenty years.<BR><BR>For the first time, Martha Ackmann tells the story of the dramatic events surrounding these thirteen remarkable women, all crackerjack pilots and patriots who sometimes sacrificed jobs and marriages for a chance to participate in America's space race against the Soviet Union. In addition to talking extensively to these women, Ackmann interviewed Chuck Yeager, John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, and others at NASA and in the White House with firsthand knowledge of the program, and includes here never-before-seen photographs of the Mercury 13 passing their Lovelace tests. <BR><BR>Despite the crushing disappointment of watching their dreams being derailed, the Mercury 13 went on to extraordinary achievement in their lives: Jerrie Cobb, who began flying when she was so small she had to sit on pillows to see out of the cockpit, dedicated her life to flying solo missions to the Amazon rain forest; Wally Funk, who talked her way into the Lovelace trials, went on to become one of the first female FAA investigators; Janey Hart, mother of eight and, at age forty, the oldest astronaut candidate, had the political savvy to steer the women through congressional hearings and later helped found the National Organization for Women. <BR><BR>A provocative tribute to these extraordinary women, The Mercury 13 is an unforgettable story of determination, resilience, and inextinguishable hope.<BR><BR>From the Hardcover edition. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"The Mercury 13 ought to be on the shelf next to The Right Stuff as a glaring and embarrassing counterpoint to the triumph of the boys' club and its fighter jocks. Ackmann has done outstanding investigative reporting." -William E. Burrows, author of This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age<BR>"[A] sharply pointed narrative [about how thirteen] highly skilled fliers were grounded, leaving it to the Russians to put a woman in space fully twenty years before the American government saw fit to do so. A shameful episode exposed with thoroughness and a graceful pen." -Kirkus Reviews<BR>"The Mercury 13 women were not only dedicated and determined, they were enormously talented. To read about their accomplishments and to discover their passion to fly is to recognize an incredible lost opportunity." -from the Foreword by Lynn Sherr<BR><BR>From the Hardcover edition.

Peter Ackroyd, one of Britain's most acclaimed writers, brings the age of the Tudors to vivid life in this monumental book in his The History of England series, charting the course of English history from Henry VIII's cataclysmic break with Rome to the epic rule of Elizabeth I.<BR><BR>Rich in detail and atmosphere, Tudors is the story of Henry VIII's relentless pursuit of both the perfect wife and the perfect heir; of how the brief royal reign of the teenage king, Edward VI, gave way to the violent reimposition of Catholicism and the stench of bonfires under "Bloody Mary." It tells, too, of the long reign of Elizabeth I, which, though marked by civil strife, plots against her, and even an invasion force, finally brought stability.<BR><BR>Above all, it is the story of the English Reformation and the making of the Anglican Church. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, England was still largely feudal and looked to Rome for direction; at its end, it was a country where good governance was the duty of the state, not the church, and where men and women began to look to themselves for answers rather than to those who ruled them.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>*Starred Review* The Tudor era was pivotal in English history and remains of perennial interest to the general reader. Ackroyd takes on this much-written-about family history in his new, highly engaging book. His bona fides as an author to trust and enjoy rest on many well-appreciated nonfiction titles, including London: The Biography (2001), and compelling novels, among them Chatterton (1987), a historical novel about poet Thomas Chatterton (1752-70). Ackroyd's primary interest here is how the reformation of the English church came about. From the time when Henry VIII's desperation over the lack of a male heir compelled him to set aside his first queen, Catherine of Aragon, to when his second wife Anne Boleyn's daughter, the glorious Elizabeth I, died after a long, complicated reign that nevertheless brought peace to the land, Ackroyd presents in rich prose and careful explanations how the English Reformation was not a movement of the people but a personal project of King Henry, who, Ackroyd insists, remained, despite his removal of papal authority over the English church, an orthodox Catholic. Under his immediate heir, the boy-king Edward VI, England veered sharply Protestant, but Edward's elder sister, Mary I, during her brief occupancy of the throne, forced England back to full Catholicism. The genius of the next and last of Henry VIII's children, Elizabeth I, was to establish a middle course between these two extremes. --Brad Hooper<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Peter Ackroyd's love of his subject shines through every page. This is a thrilling story that will delight readers interested in this period." âSan Francisco Book Review<BR><BR>"While the author focuses on the politics of religious change, this is an accessible account, made even more so by anecdotes revealing the personalities of the main characters (e.g., Henry VIII became so obese that his bed had to be enlarged to a width of seven feet, and Mary Stuart wore crimson underclothes at her execution in 1587)." âPublishers Weekly<BR><BR>"A solid multivolume popular history: readable, entirely nonrevisionist and preoccupied by politics, religion and monarchs--a worthy rival to Winston Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples." âKirkus Reviews<BR><BR>"Highly engaging.... Ackroyd presents in rich prose and careful explanations how the English Reformation was not a movement of the people but a personal project of King Henry." âBooklist (starred review)<BR><BR>"Peter Ackroyd is energetic and gifted enough to have mastered his sources and produced a sparklingly fresh account of Tudor England. ...Ackroyd has a wonderful eye for the telling detail, cameos that stick in the mind. ... If you want a finely written, racy account of the monster Henry VIII and his brood, a history book that really fires your imagination and is often so exciting that you cannot put it down, you should get this book." âThe Weekly Standard<BR><BR>"Ackroyd presents the Tudors in a way frequently overlooked by other popular histories and novels, depicting them as a force that continues to affect both English and international societies today, rather than as an early-modern soap opera. ... Each player in this real-life historical drama is clearly drawn, their major contributions and connections made apparent without losing the thread of the overall themes.

"First published in Great Britain by Macmillan, an imprint of Pan Macmillan."<BR><BR>"In Revolution, Peter Ackroyd takes readers from William of Orange's accession following the Glorious Revolution to the Regency, when the flamboyant Prince of Wales ruled in the stead of his mad father, George III, and England was--again--at war with France, a war that would end with the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. Late Stuart and Georgian England marked the creation of the great pillars of the English state. The Bank of England was founded, as was the stock exchange; the Church of England was fully established as the guardian of the spiritual life of the nation, and parliament became the sovereign body of the nation with responsibilities and duties far beyond those of the monarch. It was a revolutionary era in English letters, too, a time in which newspapers first flourished and the English novel was born. It was an era in which coffee houses and playhouses boomed, gin flowed freely, and in which shops, as we know them today, began to proliferate in towns and villages. But it was also a time of extraordinary and unprecedented technological innovation, which saw England utterly and irrevocably transformed from a country of blue skies and farmland to one of soot and steel and coal"-- Provided by publisher.<BR><BR>What do you think of predestination now? -- A bull or a bear? -- The idol of the age -- Hay day -- The prose of gold -- Waiting for the day -- The great Scriblerus -- The Germans are coming! -- Bubbles in the air -- The invisible hand -- Consuming passions -- The what d' ye call it? -- The dead ear -- Mother Geneva -- The pack of cards -- What shall i do? -- Do or die -- The violists -- A call for liberty -- Here we are again! -- The broad bottom -- The magical machines -- Having a tea party -- The schoolboy -- The steam machines -- On a darkling plain -- Fire and moonlight -- The red bonnet -- The mad kings -- The beast and the whore -- A Romantic tale -- Pleasures of peace.<BR><BR>ix, 403 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates : illustrations (chiefly color) ; 25 cm.

One of the greatest histories ever written in English, Henry Adams's History of the United States is remarkable for its fullness of detail, its penetrating insight, and above all its strong, lively, and ironic style. First published in nine volumes from 1889 to 1891, this classic work was out of print for several decades until The Library of America reissued it in two volumes: the first volume on the years of Thomas Jefferson's presidency and the second devoted to those of James Madison.<BR><BR>With a cast of characters including Aaron Burr, Napoleon Bonaparte, Albert Gallatin, John Randolph, Toussaint L'Ouverture, and the complex, brilliantly delineated character of Thomas Jefferson, the first volume is unrivaled in its handling of diplomatic intrigue and political factionalism. Upon assuming office, Jefferson discovers that his optimistic laissez-faire principles--designed to prevent American government from becoming a militaristic European "tyranny"--clash with the realities of European war and American security. The party of small government presides over the Louisiana Purchase, the most extensive use of executive power the country has yet seen. Jefferson's embargo--a high-minded effort at peaceable coercion--breeds corruption and smuggling, and the former defender of states' rights is forced to use federal power to suppress them. The passion for peace and liberty pushes the country toward war.<BR><BR>In the center of these ironic reversals, played out in a Washington full of diplomatic intrigue, is the complex figure of Jefferson himself, part tragic visionary, part comic mock-hero. Like his contemporary Napoleon Bonaparte, he is swept into power by the rising tide of democratic nationalism; unlike Bonaparte, he tries to avert the consequences of the wolfish struggle for power among nation-states.<BR><BR>The grandson of one president and the great-grandson of another, Adams gained access to hitherto secret archives in Europe. The diplomatic documents that lace the history lend a novelistic intimacy to scenes such as Jefferson's conscientious introduction of democratic table manners into stuffily aristocratic state dinner parties. Written in a strong, lively style pointed with Adams's wit, the History chronicles the consolidation of American character, and poses questions about the future course of democracy.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Born in 1838 into one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Boston, a family which had produced two American presidents, Henry Adams had the opportunity to pursue a wide-ranging variety of intellectual interests during the course of his life. Functioning both in the world of practical men and afffairs (as a journalist and an assistant to his father, who was an American diplomat in Washinton and London), and in the world of ideas (as a prolific writer, the editor of the prestigious North American Review, and a professor of medieval, european, and American history at Harvard), Adams was one of the few men of his era who attempted to understand art, thought, culture, and history as one complex force field of interacting energies. His two masterworks in this dazzling effort are Mont Saint Michel and Chartres and The Education of Henry Adams, published one after the other in 1904 and 1907. Taken together they may be read as Adams' spiritual autobiography-two monumental volumes in which he attempts to bring together into a vast synthesis all of his knowledge of politics, economics, psychology, science, philosophy, art, and literature in order to attempt to understand the individual's place in history and society. They constitute one of the greatest historical and philosophical meditations on the human condition in all of literature.

Practical Customer Success Management is a complete "handbook for CSMs", written by a customer success expert who has coached and trained many hundreds of customer success managers across the globe. The book is aimed at increasing both productivity and consistency of quality of output for customer success managers of all levels, from relative newcomers through to seasoned professionals. The book is highly practical in nature and is packed full of good humored but very direct advice and assistance for dealing with exactly the types of real world situations CSMs face every day.<BR><BR>Practical Customer Success Management provides a simple-to-follow, best practice framework that explains what the core customer success management steps are at each stage of the customer journey to business outcome success and in what circumstances to apply those steps. It describes and explains which situations each step applies to and provides recommendations for activities or tasks that the CSM can perform to complete each step, together with detailed explanations and step-by-step guidance for successfully completing each activity or task. <BR><BR>Included in this book is an entire suite of tools and templates that enable rapid completion of each task and ensure consistency of approach both across multiple customer engagements and by multiple CSMs within a team. Each tool's use is clearly explained within the book, and CSMs are able to adapt and customize the tools to suit their own specific needs as they see fit.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Practical Customer Success Management is a must read playbook for all business leaders and customer success-focused professionals. It imparts a solid grounding in what customer success is and why it is so important, whilst highlighting key challenges and how to respond to them. In addition it provides a detailed practical framework that explains both what to do and how to do it at every stage of the customer success engagement." <BR><BR>Jason Noble Global Customer Success and SaaS Leader <BR><BR>"Practical Customer Success Management is unique from any other customer success management book I've read in that it bridges the gap between the theory of customer success and the reality of actually implementing a customer success program. The templates provide the jumpstart needed to either stand up a new framework or to bridge gaps in an existing framework. This is a welcome addition to my customer success library!"<BR><BR>Theresa Campbell Customer Experience Executive Presidio<BR><BR>"This book contains so much common sense that my neck was getting tired from nodding my head in agreement so often. As you read the material, and especially if you're a seasoned customer success professional, you immediately recognize that it was written by someone with many years of deep experience working with clients. And I think that's where Rick Adams' book is differentiated from most of the other customer success content that has been published. He's clearly coming at this from years of customer leadership in real life scenarios, from the trenches in which it seems he was able to work with customers week by week to help them methodically advance in their ability to adopt more of a product or service in order to achieve their goals. And that's what customer success is all about."<BR><BR>Peter Armaly Senior Director Customer Success Oracle<BR><BR>"As a relative newcomer to Customer Success, I have found this book to be an invaluable resource. Customer Success as a function within my organization is still in its infancy, and for that reason, there is much that remains to be built out and standardized. I feel as though we've done a good job of making the best with what we have, but I am someone that thrives when there is a structured roadmap to follow. That is precisely what this book offers, and does so with great detail. I found so many of the scenarios and examples to be extremely relatable, and the recommended processes highly applicable. I plan to implement Rick's framework not only to my day-to-day activities, but also to serve as our Customer Success team's playbook and guide."<BR><BR>Dan Louks Customer Success Manager Hiring Solved<BR><BR>"I wish a book like this existed when I started in Customer Success! I've been in the role for more than half of my career and I was impressed with the book's vast coverage of the multiple facets and nuances of the Customer Success position. Practical Customer Success Management is a great foundational book for learning the principles and applications of Customer Success and a good practical guide, well laid out enough to be easily referenceable and easily digested." <BR><BR>Cyn Taylor Enterprise Customer Success Manager LogicMonitor<BR><BR>"This book provides a comprehensive review of the Customer Success role and responsibilities as distinctly different from overall customer experience and applicable to any business, not just SaaS. Onboarding, adoption planning, and adoption implementation are described in depth and there are immediately usable recommendations to execute each phase effectively."<BR><BR>Anne Marie Ponder Senior Manager, IT Infrastucture Astellas Pharma US<BR><BR>"In his book, Adams not only clarifies what customer success management is, but he also provides all the ingredients to create the right customer success strategy. If you need to implement customer success within your own company, or if you are a CSM who simply wants an authoritative guide to customer success management best practices then dive in!"<BR><BR>Baptiste Debever Head of Growth & Co Founder Alkalab<BR><BR>"It is refreshing to see a book that articulates easy-to-follow concepts of customer success management using real-life examples on how to perform the role more effectively and efficiently. Adams' style of writing is entertaining and very simple to digest, and what I particularly appreciated is the way in which he has broken down complex challenges and made them easy to understand for customer success managers to apply in everyday situations when serving their customers."<BR><BR>Samuel Parri Global Success Manager and Senior Program Leader <BR><BR>"The growth of Customer Success as a corporate discipline has been remarkable and continues unabated. Rick's excellent book is an invaluable resource for anyone with an interest in Customer Success. Whether you are contemplating your first foray into Customer Success or are a seasoned executive, this book provides both the framework and practical guides to help ensure that you have the best-practice structures and processes in place for both today and the future."<BR><BR>Adam Joseph CEO CSM Insight<BR><BR>"A structured and logical approach that will help new and experienced CSMs to bridge the gap between Customer Success theory and practical application."<BR><BR>James Scott General Partner Success Hacker <BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Rick Adams is an independent author, trainer and consultant, specializing in helping companies of all types and sizes deliver measurable business value for their customers.

The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and nonfiction writers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking-technique. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. It does not matter if you prefer taking notes with pen and paper or on a computer, be it Windows, Mac or Linux. And you can start right away.

On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed their Lunar Module on the moon's Sea of Tranquility and became the first two humans to walk on the moon. This unprecedented heroic endeavor was witnessed by the largest worldwide television audience in history. Marking the 20th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, Buzz publishes Men From Earth, a detailed and astonishing account of America's race with the Soviets to the moon. The book ends with an epilogue venturing Outward, which looks toward future space travel through the year 2009.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>To coincide with the 20th anniversary this July of the first manned lunar landing, these books provide intimate accounts of how NASA accomplished the national goal of putting a man on the moon before the end of the decade. In his book, Aldrin, the second man on the moon, interweaves the story of U.S. and Soviet efforts to reach the moon with his first-hand experience flying both the Gemini and Apollo missions during the height of the space race. His recounting of his two space flights is compelling, especially the account of the nearly aborted Apollo 11 lunar landing. In contrast to Aldrin's astronaut's point of view, Murray and Cox's book tells the Apollo story through the eyes of the NASA managers who guided the men and machines from the early days of the Space Task Group to the Apollo lunar missions. The result is the best account to date of how the enormous program was successfully accomplished. Full of insiders' anecdotes, this book truly humanizes the lunar landing story that too often has been told only in technological and bureaucratic terms. Relying heavily on interviews with the people behind the scenes, the authors vividly capture the spirit of Apollo, its triumphs and tragedies, and its ultimate success. When considering the likely demand for Apollo histories surrounding the anniversary, Aldrin's account may be considered complementary to his Apollo 11 crewmate Michael Collins's recent space history, Liftoff ( LJ 8/88). A review of Douglas MacKinnon and Joseph Baldanza's Footprints: The 12 Men Who Walked on the Moon Reflect on Their Flights, Their Lives and the Future , to be published by Acropolis in July, is scheduled to appear in our next issue.-- Ed. But for libraries considering only one title, Murray and Cox's book should be considered the essential purchase.<BR>- Thomas J.

Three novels tell of love and horror beyond the grave, cruel and unusual punishment for a child abuser, and a dead man forced to choose between equally terrifying alternatives<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Imaginative and moving, the three horror novellas collected here outline the redemptive powers of love. In "Cafe Purgatorium" by newcomer Anderson, a man falls in love with a dead woman who comes alive at night in the cafe where he lives. She is one of a group of people who died on the premises and who now return with darkness to dance and drink till dawn. Unable to endure existence without his inamorata, the suitor eventually makes a bargain with Satan. The couple in Garton's ( Live Girls ) "Dr. Krusadian's Method" isn't offered a choice. If the two do not cooperate with the good doctor, they will face imprisonment for abusing their son. After Krusadian gives them a taste of their own medicine, they begin to wish for death rather than deal with him. Death seems imminent for the young protagonist of "Death Leaves an Echo" by de Lint ( The Little Country ) as he careens off a highway. He wakes up from a dream, however, to find that his cherished wife and all her things are missing. As everyone around him denies her existence, he continues his search, watching helplessly as the threads of his life begin to unravel. Each of these works speaks to the importance of love in shifting the balance of power between the forces of good and evil. <BR>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Three original novellas make a strong case for the vitality of fantasy's more macabre side. Anderson's "Cafe Purgatorium" tells a bittersweet story of a ghostly lover, a haunted dance hall, and a deal with the devil. In "Dr. Krusadian's Method," Ray Garton explores a unique and unforgettable cure for child abuse. "Death Leaves an Echo" brings Charles de Lint's gentle style to a dying man's struggle to choose between worlds. Purchase where there is a demand for horror of the subtler, non-splatter variety.<BR>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>``Three original novels of horror and the fantastic'' claims the publisher in its catalogue and galley copy. Well, not quite. It turns out that these are novellas, not novels; and, more importantly, the longest work here--Garton's ``Dr. Krusadian's Method''--appeared in his Methods of Madness collection (1990). Moreover, the quality here is, at best, just a cut above 1950's pulp--and that's in the last and shortest novella. Readers must first slog through Anderson's lumpy title story, in which a man buys a haunted nightclub, learns that the souls therein are coveted by Lucifer, and does bloody battle with His minions, winning with the same principle that allowed the Little Engine to go up the hill. As short-story writer Anderson's longest published work, this bodes poorly; Garton, whose ``Dr. Krusadian's Method'' comes next, can at least fall back on having written one of the wittiest of splatterpunk novels, Live Girls (1987 paperback). Here, in a yarn about an occult cure for child abuse, the splatter is in full force, if not the wit. More appealing is de Lint's ``Death Leaves an Echo,'' in which this prolific mass-market fantasist (Jack the Giant Killer, 1990, etc.) spins a catchy premise--a man wakes up to find every trace of his wife gone from the world--and embroiders it inventively. The revelatory climax lacks the drama of the premise and is preceded by some gratuitously graphic sex, but, overall de Lint spools out a smooth and satisfying yarn. Skip the Anderson, rip out the Garton, you're left with one decent novella--for $18.95? -- Copyright ©1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.

Written by a distinguished mathematician and teacher, this undergraduate text uses a combinatorial approach to accommodate both math majors and liberal arts students. In addition to covering the basics of number theory, it offers an outstanding introduction to partitions, plus chapters on multiplicativity-divisibility, quadratic congruences, additivity, and more.<BR><BR>Although mathematics majors are usually conversant with number theory by the time they have completed a course in abstract algebra, other undergraduates, especially those in education and the liberal arts, often need a more basic introduction to the topic. In this book, the author solves the problem of maintaining the interest of students at both levels by offering a combinatorial approach to elementary number theory. Among the topics covered in this accessible, carefully designed introduction are:<BR><BR>Multiplicativity-divisibility, including the fundamental theorem of arithmetic<BR><BR>Combinatorial and computational number theory<BR><BR>Congruences, arithmetic functions, primitive roots and prime numbers<BR><BR>Later chapters offer lucid treatments of quadratic congruences, additivity (including partition theory), and geometric number theory<BR><BR>Of particular importance in this text is the author's emphasis on the value of numerical examples in number theory and the role of computers in obtaining such examples. Exercises provide opportunities for constructing numerical tables with or without a computer. Students can then derive conjectures from such numerical tables, after which relevant theorems will seem natural and well-motivated.<BR><BR>Dover is widely recognized for a magnificent mathematics list featuring such world-class theorists as Paul J. Cohen (Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis), Alfred Tarski (Undecidable Theories), Gary Chartrand (Introductory Graph Theory), Hermann Weyl (The Concept of a Riemann Surface), Shlomo Sternberg (Dynamical Systems), and multiple works by C. R. Wylie in geometry, plus Stanley J. Farlow's Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>The Holy Grail of Number Theory <BR>George E. Andrews, Evan Pugh Professor of Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University, author of the well-established text Number Theory (first published by Saunders in 1971 and reprinted by Dover in 1994), has led an active career discovering fascinating phenomena in his chosen field - number theory. Perhaps his greatest discovery, however, was not solely one in the intellectual realm but in the physical world as well. <BR><BR>In 1975, on a visit to Trinity College in Cambridge to study the papers of the late mathematician George N. Watson, Andrews found what turned out to be one of the actual Holy Grails of number theory, the document that became known as the "Lost Notebook" of the great Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. It happened that the previously unknown notebook thus discovered included an immense amount of Ramanujan's original work bearing on one of Andrews' main mathematical preoccupations - mock theta functions. Collaborating with colleague Bruce C. Berndt of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Andrews has since published the first two of a planned three-volume sequence based on Ramanujan's Lost Notebook, and will see the project completed with the appearance of the third volume in the next few years. <BR><BR>In the Author's Own Words: <BR>"It seems to me that there's this grand mathematical world out there, and I am wandering through it and discovering fascinating phenomena that often totally surprise me. I do not think of mathematics as invented but rather discovered." - George E. Andrews </div

""Prior to Augustine, no author had ever turned his speculative gaze so intently upon his own life and interiority. Hence, without the 'Confessions', there would have been no Shakespearean soliloquies (in fact, Augustine coined the term soliloquia); Joyce could never have written Ulysses or A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; Freud and Jung could never have developed psychoanalysis.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Bishop Robert Barron is the founder of Word on Fire Catholic Ministries and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.

A leading translation of Stoic philosophy in wise and practical aphorisms that have inspired Bill Clinton, Ryan Holiday, Anna Kendrick and many more.<BR><BR>Written in Greek by an intellectual Roman emperor without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offer a wide range of fascinating spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the leader struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Spanning from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the question of virtue, human rationality, the nature of the gods and the values of leadership. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation, in developing his beliefs Marcus also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a series of wise and practical aphorisms that have been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and ordinary readers for almost two thousand years.<BR><BR>To provide a full understanding of Aurelius's seminal work, this edition includes explanatory notes, a general index, an index of quotations, an index of names, and an introduction by Diskin Clay putting the work in its biographical, historical, and literary context, a chronology of Marcus Aurelius's life and career.<BR><BR>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.

One of the most universally loved and admired English novels, Pride and Prejudice was penned as a popular entertainment. But the consummate artistry of Jane Austen (1775-1817) transformed this effervescent tale of rural romance into a witty, shrewdly observed satire of English country life that is now regarded as one of the principal treasures of English language.<BR>In a remote Hertfordshire village, far off the good coach roads of George III's England, a country squire of no great means must marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter Elizabeth Bennet and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to its splendid conclusion.<BR>A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.

"Saudi Arabia is more and more an irrational state--a place that spawns global terrorism even as it succumbs to an ancient and deeply seated isolationism, a kingdom led by a royal family that can't get out of the way of its own greed. Is this the fulcrum we want the global economy to balance on?"<BR><BR>In his explosive New York Times bestseller, See No Evil, former CIA operative Robert Baer exposed how Washington politics drastically compromised the CIA's efforts to fight global terrorism. Now in his powerful new book, Sleeping with the Devil, Baer turns his attention to Saudi Arabia, revealing how our government's cynical relationship with our Middle Eastern ally and America' s dependence on Saudi oil make us increasingly vulnerable to economic disaster and put us at risk for further acts of terrorism.<BR><BR>For decades, the United States and Saudi Arabia have been locked in a "harmony of interests." America counted on the Saudis for cheap oil, political stability in the Middle East, and lucrative business relationships for the United States, while providing a voracious market for the kingdom' s vast oil reserves. With money and oil flowing freely between Washington and Riyadh, the United States has felt secure in its relationship with the Saudis and the ruling Al Sa'ud family. But the rot at the core of our "friendship" with the Saudis was dramatically revealed when it became apparent that fifteen of the nineteen September 11 hijackers proved to be Saudi citizens.<BR><BR>In Sleeping with the Devil, Baer documents with chilling clarity how our addiction to cheap oil and Saudi petrodollars caused us to turn a blind eye to the Al Sa'ud's culture of bribery, its abysmal human rights record, and its financial support of fundamentalist Islamic groups that have been directly linked to international acts of terror, including those against the United States. Drawing on his experience as a field operative who was on the ground in the Middle East for much of his twenty years with the agency, as well as the large network of sources he has cultivated in the region and in the U.S. intelligence community, Baer vividly portrays our decades-old relationship with the increasingly dysfunctional and corrupt Al Sa'ud family, the fierce anti-Western sentiment that is sweeping the kingdom, and the desperate link between the two. In hopes of saving its own neck, the royal family has been shoveling money as fast as it can to mosque schools that preach hatred of America and to militant fundamentalist groups--an end game just waiting to play out.<BR><BR>Baer not only reveals the outrageous excesses of a Saudi royal family completely out of touch with the people of its kingdom, he also takes readers on a highly personal search for the deeper roots of modern terrorism, a journey that returns time again and again to Saudi Arabia: to the Wahhabis, the powerful Islamic sect that rules the Saudi street; to the Taliban and al Qaeda, both of which Saudi Arabia helped to underwrite; and to the Muslim Brotherhood, one of the most active and effective terrorist groups in existence, which the Al Sa'ud have sheltered and funded. The money and arms that we send to Saudi Arabia are, in effect, being used to cut our own throat, Baer writes, but America might have only itself to blame. So long as we continue to encourage the highly volatile Saudi state to bank our oil under its sand--and so long as we continue to grab at the Al Sa'ud's money--we are laying the groundwork for a potential global economic catastrophe.<BR><BR>From the Hardcover edition. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A chilling evaluation of today's geopolitical situation...highly recommended." <BR>--Dallas Morning News<BR><BR>"An unsettling, eye-opening account of our relationship with Saudi Arabia...

Over the past thirty years, while the United States has turned either a blind or dismissive eye, Iran has emerged as a nation every bit as capable of altering America's destiny as traditional superpowers Russia and China. Indeed, one of this book's central arguments is that, in some ways, Iran's grip on America's future is even tighter.<BR><BR>As ex-CIA operative Robert Baer masterfully shows, Iran has maneuvered itself into the elite superpower ranks by exploiting Americans' false perceptions of what Iran is-by letting us believe it is a country run by scowling religious fanatics, too preoccupied with theocratic jostling and terrorist agendas to strengthen its political and economic foundations.<BR><BR>The reality is much more frightening-and yet contained in the potential catastrophe is an implicit political response that, if we're bold enough to adopt it, could avert disaster.<BR><BR>Baer's on-the-ground sleuthing and interviews with key Middle East players-everyone from an Iranian ayatollah to the king of Bahrain to the head of Israel's internal security-paint a picture of the centuries-old Shia nation that is starkly the opposite of the one normally drawn. For example, Iran's hate-spouting President Ahmadinejad is by no means the true spokesman for Iranian foreign policy, nor is Iran making it the highest priority to become a nuclear player. <BR><BR>Even so, Baer has discovered that Iran is currently engaged in a soft takeover of the Middle East, that the proxy method of war-making and co-option it perfected with Hezbollah in Lebanon is being exported throughout the region, that Iran now controls a significant portion of Iraq, that it is extending its influence over Jordan and Egypt, that the Arab Emirates and other Gulf States are being pulled into its sphere, and that it will shortly have a firm hold on the world's oil spigot.<BR><BR>By mixing anecdotes with information gleaned from clandestine sources, Baer superbly demonstrates that Iran, far from being a wild-eyed rogue state, is a rational actor-one skilled in the game of nations and so effective at thwarting perceived Western colonialism that even rival Sunnis relish fighting under its banner.<BR><BR>For U.S. policy makers, the choices have narrowed: either cede the world's most important energy corridors to a nation that can match us militarily with its asymmetric capabilities (which include the use of suicide bombers)-or deal with the devil we know. We might just find that in allying with Iran, we'll have increased not just our own security but that of all Middle East nations.The alternative-to continue goading Iran into establishing hegemony over the Muslim world-is too chilling to contemplate.<BR><BR>From the Hardcover edition. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A masterpiece...Baer's brilliant analysis of Sunni versus Shia, Arab versus Iranian, and Christian versus Muslim is shocking, revealing, and provocative. Baer lifts the veil of Western media hype and challenges the simplistic solutions offered by 'experts' whose vision is blurred by the past. Through his knowledge, long-term experience, and ability to assess the changing landscape of this vital region, he not only shatters the foundations of conventional thinking, but also offers a practicable blueprint for turning things around."<BR>-John Perkins, author of the New York Times bestseller Confessions of an Economic Hit Man<BR><BR>"The most important and original book on the Middle East to appear in many years.

This is a book McCain and Obama should ponder."<BR>-Thomas Powers, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Man Who Kept the Secrets and Intelligence Wars<BR><BR>"The Devil We Know, Bob Baer has once again peered into the future and has brought back uncomfortable truths that won't satisfy any partisan.

In his explosive New York Times bestseller, top CIA operative Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides startling evidence of how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA's efforts to root out the world's deadliest terrorists, allowing for the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and the continued entrenchment of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.<BR><BR>A veteran case officer in the CIA's Directorate of Operations in the Middle East, Baer witnessed the rise of terrorism first hand and the CIA's inadequate response to it, leading to the attacks of September 11, 2001. This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.<BR><BR>"Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <BR>officer in the Middle East."<BR>-Seymour M. Hersh, The New Yorker<BR><BR>From The Preface<BR>This book is a memoir of one foot soldier's career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It's a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don't need to do business with.<BR><BR>This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.<BR><BR>The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"See No Evil is a compelling account of America's failed efforts to 'listen in' on the rest of the world, especially the parts of it that intend to do us harm." <BR>-Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field <BR>officer in the Middle East."<BR>-Seymour M.

An odyssey through the art, theory, and brutality of modern political murder by Robert Baer, New York Times-bestselling author, former CIA operative, and, yes, assassin<BR><BR>All four of Robert B. Baer's previous books were New York Times bestsellers, and it's no wonder. A recipient of the Career Intelligence Medal, Baer served as a CIA operative for decades, and his career was the model for the acclaimed movie Syriana. Now, Baer draws on his extensive firsthand experience--including a decades-long cat-and-mouse hunt for the greatest assassin of the modern age--to examine the serpentine history of political murder. Offering a tantalizing glimpse at the underbelly of world politics, The Perfect Kill will be avidly read by thriller fans and military history buffs alike. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A best-selling author and former CIA operative chronicles his experiences as an assassin while offering chilling insight into the fine art of political murder...

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Whether all human languages are fundamentally the same or different has been a subject of debate for ages. This problem has deep philosophical implications: If languages are all the same, it implies a fundamental commonality--and thus mutual intelligibility--of human thought.We are now on the verge of solving this problem. Using a twenty-year-old theory proposed by the world's greatest living linguist, Noam Chomsky, researchers have found that the similarities among languages are more profound than the differences. Languages whose grammars seem completely incompatible may in fact be structurally almost identical, except for a difference in one simple rule. The discovery of these rules and how they may vary promises to yield a linguistic equivalent of the Periodic Table of the Elements: a single framework by which we can understand the fundamental structure of all human language. This is a landmark breakthrough both within linguistics, which will herewith finally become a full-fledged science, and in our understanding of the human mind.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Mark C. Baker is a professor in the Department of Linguistics and the Center for Cognitive Science at Rutgers University. He lives in Camden, New Jersey.

Featuring thirty-two pages of photographs, the comedienne's own recently discovered memoirs, penned more than thirty years ago, recounts her career, including her marriage to Desi Arnaz and their life on and behind the TV screen. 300,000 first printing. $200,000 ad/promo. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>Although Lucille Ball died in 1989, this autobiography written prior to 1964 has only recently been discovered among her papers. She describes a childhood deeply affected by her father's death and her mother's withdrawal from her life. Raised by her grandparents, Ball craved attention and developed a tempestuous, vivacious, fiery, and yet insecure personality that would later lead her to comic stardom. It took years of working from the bottom of show business before she became a television hit, with the help of her husband, co-star, and business partner, former Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz. Ball abandoned the book for fear of hurting Arnaz, although she gives him credit for the tremendous success she enjoyed with "I Love Lucy."

The enduring and engaging guide to educating yourself in the classical tradition.<BR><BR>Have you lost the art of reading for pleasure? Are there books you know you should read but haven't because they seem too daunting? In The Well-Educated Mind, Susan Wise Bauer provides a welcome and encouraging antidote to the distractions of our age, electronic and otherwise.<BR><BR>Newly expanded and updated to include standout works from the twenty-first century as well as essential readings in science (from the earliest works of Hippocrates to the discovery of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs), The Well-Educated Mind offers brief, entertaining histories of six literary genres-fiction, autobiography, history, drama, poetry, and science-accompanied by detailed instructions on how to read each type. The annotated lists at the end of each chapter-ranging from Cervantes to Cormac McCarthy, Herodotus to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, Aristotle to Stephen Hawking-preview recommended reading and encourage readers to make vital connections between ancient traditions and contemporary writing.<BR><BR>The Well-Educated Mind reassures those readers who worry that they read too slowly or with below-average comprehension. If you can understand a daily newspaper, there's no reason you can't read and enjoy Shakespeare's sonnets or Jane Eyre. But no one should attempt to read the "Great Books" without a guide and a plan. Bauer will show you how to allocate time to reading on a regular basis; how to master difficult arguments; how to make personal and literary judgments about what you read; how to appreciate the resonant links among texts within a genre-what does Anna Karenina owe to Madame Bovary?-and also between genres.<BR><BR>In her best-selling work on home education, The Well-Trained Mind, the author provided a road map of classical education for parents wishing to home-school their children; that book is now the premier resource for home-schoolers. In The Well-Educated Mind, Bauer takes the same elements and techniques and adapts them to the use of adult readers who want both enjoyment and self-improvement from the time they spend reading. Followed carefully, her advice will restore and expand the pleasure of the written word.

The classic handbook on home schooling updated for a new generation of parents and students.<BR><BR>Is your child getting lost in the system, becoming bored, losing his or her natural eagerness to learn? If so, it may be time to take charge of your child's education by doing it yourself<BR><BR>The Well-Trained Mind will instruct you, step by step, on how to give your child an academically rigorous, comprehensive education from preschool through high schoolâone that will train him or her to read, to think, to understand, to be well-rounded and curious about learning. Veteran home educator Susan Wise Bauer outlines the classical pattern of education called the trivium, which organizes learning around the maturing capacity of the child's mind and comprises three stages: the elementary school "grammar stage," when the building blocks of information are absorbed through memorization and rules; the middle school "logic stage," in which the student begins to think more analytically; and the high-school "rhetoric stage," where the student learns to write and speak with force and originality. Using this theory as your model, you'll be able to instruct your childâwhether full-time or as a supplement to classroom educationâin all levels of reading, writing, history, geography, mathematics, science, foreign languages, rhetoric, logic, art, and music, regardless of your own aptitude in those subjects. A new optional Resource Recommendations Portal provides subscribers with curated lists of the best curricula for every grade level and learning style.<BR><BR>Thousands of parents have already used the methods described in The Well-Trained Mind to create a truly superior education for children in their care. You do have control over what and how your child learns.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>A few years ago, resiliency theory was relatively new to the fields of prevention and education. Today, it is at the heart of hundreds of school and community programs that recognize in all young people the capacity to lead healthy, successful lives. The key, as Benard reports in this synthesis of a decade and more of resiliency research, is the role that families, schools, and communities play in supporting, and not undermining, this biological drive for normal human development. Of special interest is the evidence that resiliency prevails in most cases by far -- even in extreme situations, such as those caused by poverty, troubled families, and violent neighborhoods. <BR>An understanding of this developmental wisdom and the supporting research, Benard argues, must be integrated into adults' vision for the youth they work with and communicated to young people themselves. Benard's analysis of how best to incorporate research findings to support young people is both realistic and inspirational. It is an easy-to-read discussion of what the research has found along with descriptions of what application of the research looks like in our most successful efforts to support young people.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>As a Senior Program Associate at WestEd since 1999, Bonnie Benard is responsible for developing applications of resilience and youth development research for the Health and Human Development Program. She had primary responsibility for the development of the California Department of Education's Healthy Kids Survey's Resilience and Youth Development Module, which surveys students throughout California on their perceptions of supports and opportunities in their schools, homes, communities, and peer groups. <BR><BR>During her career, Benard has written widely, provided training, and made presentations for national and international audiences in the field of prevention and resilience/youth development theory, policy, and practice. From 1990 through 1996, Benard was a Research Associate at WestEd's Western Center for Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities, where she published Fostering Resiliency in Kids: Protective Factors in the Family, School, and Community (1991), a document credited with introducing resiliency theory and application to the fields of prevention and education. In 1992, she received the Award of Excellence from the National Prevention Network; in 1995, the Paul Templin Award for Service by Western Center for Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities; in 1997, the Spirit of Crazy Horse Award from the Black Hills Reclaiming Youth seminars for her advocacy of resilience and strength-based practice; and in 2002, the Paul D. Hood Award from WestEd for Distinguished Contribution to the Field. <BR><BR>Benard received a BA in English and an MSW, both from the University of Missouri, Columbia.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Before his death in 1832, Charles Carroll of Carrollton - the last living signer of the Declaration of Independence - was widely regarded as one of the most important founders. This is his biography.<BR><BR>Book Description:<BR><BR>Before his death in 1832, Charles Carroll of Carrollton was widely regarded as among the most important of the American founders. Today, however, Carroll's signal contributions to the American founding are largely overlooked. In the fascinating new biography American Cicero, historian Bradley J. Birzer rescues Carroll from this unjust neglect. Drawing on his considerable archival research and study of Carroll's extensive correspondence, Birzer shows how this man of supreme intellect, imagination, and integrity recognized the necessity of independence from Great Britain well before most other founders, advocated a proper understanding of the American Revolution as deeply rooted in the Western tradition, inspired the creation of the U.S. Senate, and helped legitimize his religion, Roman Catholicism, in the American republic. Born a bastard, Carroll nevertheless became the best educated and wealthiest founder. His analysis of the situation in the colonies in the run-up to the Revolution, though ignored by almost all historians, was original and brilliant, Birzer shows. Carroll eventually served as one of the main informants for Alexis de Tocqueville's classic work Democracy in America. American Ciceroreveals why founders such as John Adams assumed that Charles Carroll would one day be considered among the greats--and also why history has largely forgotten him.

Information is endlessly available to us; where shall wisdom be found?" is the crucial question with which renowned literary critic Harold Bloom begins this impassioned book on the pleasures and benefits of reading well. For more than forty years, Bloom has transformed college students into lifelong readers with his unrivaled love for literature. Now, at a time when faster and easier electronic media threatens to eclipse the practice of reading, Bloom draws on his experience as critic, teacher, and prolific reader to plumb the great books for their sustaining wisdom. <BR>Shedding all polemic, Bloom addresses the solitary reader, who, he urges, should read for the purest of all reasons: to discover and augment the self. His ultimate faith in the restorative power of literature resonates on every page of this infinitely rewarding and important book.

Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a must-read for any fan of science fiction or fantasy, a crucial precursor to films like Avatar and Alien and books like Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars and Dan Simmons' Hyperion, and a haunting prophesy of humanity's destiny to bring our old dreams and follies along with us wherever we may venture forth.<BR><BR>Soar above the fossil seas and crystal pillars of a dead world in the pages of Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles. A milestone of American literature, Bradbury's classic collection of interconnected vignettes about life on the red planet diverges from the War of the Worlds theme, in which humanity must defend its shores against its neighbors, for in Bradbury's prismatic vision, humanity is the conqueror, colonizing Mars to escape an Earth devastated by atomic war and environmental catastrophe.

Internationally acclaimed with more than 5 million copies in print, Fahrenheit 451 is Ray Bradbury's classic novel of censorship and defiance, as resonant today as it was when it was first published nearly 50 years ago.<BR><BR>Guy Montag was a fireman whose job it was to start fires... <BR><BR>The system was simple. Everyone understood it. Books were for burning ... along with the houses in which they were hidden. <BR><BR>Guy Montag enjoyed his job. He had been a fireman for ten years, and he had never questioned the pleasure of the midnight runs nor the joy of watching pages consumed by flames... never questioned anything until he met a seventeen-year-old girl who told him of a past when people were not afraid. <BR><BR>Then he met a professor who told him of a future in which people could think... and Guy Montag suddenly realized what he had to do!<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From the Publisher<BR>FARENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury<BR>There are some books that no matter how long ago you've read them, details<BR>from the story stick in your mind. Farenheit 451 was like that for me. I<BR>was 15 when I first checked it out from the high school library. I hadn't<BR>really gotten very far into the book when a cute guy noticed I was carrying<BR>it around school.<BR>"Good book," he commented.<BR>"Yeah, I'm still reading it," I answered. Wow, I thought, approval from an<BR>older guy. That gave me the incentive to finish what turned out to be one<BR>of the most important sf novels ever written.<BR>It's been more than 20 years since I've spoken to but I'll always feel<BR>grateful to him whenever I hear about bookburnings. His tiny bit of<BR>encouragement introduced me to one of the genre's finest writers.<BR><BR>--Amy Stout, Consulting Editor <BR><BR>From the Inside Flap<BR>Nowadays firemen start fires. Fireman Guy Montag loves to rush to a fire and watch books burn up.

Then he met a seventeen-year old girl who told him of a past when people were not afraid, and a professor who told him of a future where people could think. And Guy Montag knew what he had to do....<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Ray Bradbury is America's foremost writer of science fiction and fantasy. Among his most popular adult books are Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Dandelion Wine, and Death is a Lonely Business. In addition, he has written several books for children, including Switch on the Night. In recognition of his stature in the world of literature and the impact he has had on so many for so many years, Bradbury was awarded the National Book Foundation's 2000 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, and the National Medal of Arts in 2004.<BR><BR>He lives in Los Angeles.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>It was a pleasure to burn.<BR><BR>It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned dark with burning.<BR><BR>Montag grinned the fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame.<BR><BR>He knew that when he returned to the firehouse, he might wink at himself, a minstrel man, burnt-corked, in the mirror. Later, going to sleep, he would feel the fiery smile still gripped by his face muscles, in the dark. It never went away, that smile, it never ever went away, as long as he remembered.<BR><BR>He hung up his black beetle-colored helmet and shined it; he hung his flameproof jacket neatly; he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.<BR><BR>He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the silent air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out with a great puff of warm air onto the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.<BR><BR>Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the corner, thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.<BR><BR>The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment prior to his making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a person's standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk, with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his eyes or speak.<BR><BR>But now tonight, he slowed almost to a stop. His inner mind, reaching out to turn the corner for him, had heard the faintest whisper. Breathing? Or was the atmosphere compressed merely by someone standing very quietly there, waiting?<BR><BR>He turned the corner.<BR><BR>The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry her forward. Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white, and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered. He almost thought he heard the motion of her hands as she walked, and the infinitely small sound now, the white stir of her face turning when she discovered she was a moment away from a man who stood in the middle of the pavement waiting.<BR><BR>The trees overhead made a great sound of letting down their dry rain. The girl stopped and looked as if she might pull back in surprise, but instead stood regarding Montag with eyes so dark and shining and alive that he felt he had said something quite wonderful. But he knew his mouth had only moved to say hello, and then when she seemed hypnotized by the salamander on his arm and the phoenix disc on his chest, he spoke again.<BR><BR>"Of course," he said, "you're our new neighbor, aren't you?"<BR><BR>"And you must be"-she raised her eyes from his professional symbols "-the fireman." Her voice trailed off.<BR><BR>"How oddly you say that."<BR><BR>"I'd-I'd have known it with my eyes shut," she said, slowly.<BR><BR>"What-the smell of kerosene? My wife always complains," he laughed. "You never wash it off completely."<BR><BR>"No, you don't," she said, in awe.<BR><BR>He felt she was walking in a circle about him, turning him end for end, shaking him quietly, and emptying his pockets, without once moving herself.<BR><BR>"Kerosene," he said, because the silence had lengthened, "is nothing but perfume to me."<BR><BR>"Does it seem like that, really?"<BR><BR>"Of course. Why not?"<BR><BR>She gave herself time to think of it. "I don't know." She turned to face the sidewalk going toward their homes. "Do you mind if I walk back with you? I'm Clarisse McClellan."<BR><BR>"Clarisse. Guy Montag. Come along. What are you doing out so late wandering around? How old are you?"<BR><BR>They walked in the warm-cool blowing night on the silvered pavement and there was the faintest breath of fresh apricots and strawberries in the air, and he looked around and realized this was quite impossible, so late in the year.<BR><BR>There was only the girl walking with him now, her face bright as snow in the moonlight, and he knew she was working his questions around, seeking the best answers she could possibly give.<BR><BR>"Well," she said, "I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane. Isn't this a nice time of night to walk? I like to smell things and look at things, and sometimes stay up all night, walking, and watch the sun rise."<BR><BR>They walked on again in silence and finally she said, thoughtfully, "You know, I'm not afraid of you at all."<BR><BR>He was surprised. "Why should you be?"<BR><BR>"So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean. But you're just a man, after all . . ."<BR><BR>He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water, himself dark and tiny, in fine detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact. Her face, turned to him now, was fragile milk crystal with a soft and constant light in it. It was not the hysterical light of electricity but-what? But the strangely comfortable and rare and gently flattering light of the candle. One time, as a child, in a power failure, his mother had found and lit a last candle and there had been a brief hour of rediscovery, of such illumination that space lost its vast dimensions and grew comfortably around them, and they, mother and son, alone, transformed, hoping that the power might not come on again too soon . . .<BR><BR>And then Clarisse McClellan said:<BR><BR>"Do you mind if I ask? How long've you worked at being a fireman?"<BR><BR>"Since I was twenty, ten years ago."<BR><BR>"Do you ever read any of the books you burn?"<BR><BR>He laughed. "That's against the law!"<BR><BR>"Oh. Of course."<BR><BR>"It's fine work. Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner, burn 'em to ashes, then burn the ashes. That's our official slogan."<BR><BR>They walked still farther and the girl said, "Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?"<BR><BR>"No. Houses have always been fireproof, take my word for it."<BR><BR>"Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames."<BR><BR>He laughed.<BR><BR>She glanced quickly over. "Why are you laughing?"<BR><BR>"I don't know." He started to laugh again and stopped. "Why?"<BR><BR>"You laugh when I haven't been funny and you answer right off. You never stop to think what I've asked you."<BR><BR>He stopped walking. "You are an odd one," he said, looking at her. "Haven't you any respect?"<BR><BR>"I don't mean to be insulting. It's just I love to watch people too much, I guess."<BR><BR>"Well, doesn't this mean anything to you?" He tapped the numerals 451 stitched on his char-colored sleeve.<BR><BR>"Yes," she whispered. She increased her pace. "Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way?"<BR><BR>"You're changing the subject!"<BR><BR>"I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly," she said. "If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur! That's a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isn't that funny, and sad, too?"

Four classics of the imagination from one of America's most beloved authors--including the complete Martian Chronicles.<BR><BR>A master storyteller and visionary champion of creative freedom, Ray Bradbury is one of the most beloved and influential writers of our time. To explore the worlds of his books, his astonishing futures and haunting pasts, is to rediscover the wondrous possibilities of life. This Library of America edition gathers four of his greatest works in a single volume. Here is The Martian Chronicles in the complete form Bradbury came to prefer, its twenty-eight linked story-chapters offering visionary glimpses of our spacefaring future. In the dystopian thriller Fahrenheit 451, books and all they contain are forbidden. Dandelion Wine distills the enchanting essences of a childhood summer, while Something Wicked This Way Comes conjures the wild, centrifugal imaginings of youthful terror, in a fight to the death against supernatural foes. Biographer Jonathan R. Eller offers a newly researched chronology of Bradbury's life and career and detailed textual and explanatory notes.

In one authoritative volume, here are two landmark story collections by one of America's most beloved authors, plus 27 stellar, speculative, and strange tales from other collections, including 7 restored to print<BR><BR>The author of over 400 short stories, Ray Bradbury was a master not only in the science fiction genre, for which he is best known, but also in speculative, horror, and dark fantasy. Here are two of Bradbury's most beloved collections, along with twenty-seven other stories, that together represent the best of Bradbury's stories of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. <BR><BR>The Illustrated Man--the more Earthbound science fiction companion to Bradbury's classic collection The Martian Chronicles--contains eighteen short stories bound together by the unifying metaphor of a strangely tattooed outcast. The stories explore both the dehumanizing possibilities of space-age technology--in "The Veldt" and "The Rocket Man"--and the pessimistic, dark side of humanity, as in "The Visitor." <BR><BR>The October Country collects nineteen short stories: macabre carnival tales, speculative horror, and strange fantasy. "Uncle Einar" and "Homecoming" concern the monstrous and immortal Elliott family. In "The Next in Line," a woman becomes convinced that she'll never leave the small, Mexican town she's traveled to on vacation. And in "Touched with Fire," two old men have learned to predict future murders. This edition restores the original artwork by Joe Mugnaini. <BR><BR>Rounding out the volume are twenty-seven other short stories from the first half of Bradbury's career selected by Bradbury scholar Joanthan R, Eller, including "Frost and Fire," in which humans on another planet live only eight days; "The Pedestrian," about the only man in the world who does not watch television, and "I Sing the Body Electric!," in which a family purchases a robotic grandmother. Also includes such hard to find stories as "R is for Rocket," "Asleep in Armageddon," and "The Lost City of Mars." <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Ray Bradbury (1920-2012) inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Dandelion Wine, and Something Wicked This Way Comes.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>"Superb. . . . Inspiring."--Newsday. "A captivating history."--The Daily Telegraph. "A thorough and incredibly enjoyable trip down a linguistic memory lane."--Bloomsbury Review<BR><BR>Here is the riveting story of the English language, from its humble beginnings as a regional dialect to its current preeminence as the one global language, spoken by more than two billion people worldwide. In this groundbreaking book, Melvyn Bragg shows how English conquered the world. It is a magnificent adventure, full of jealousy, intrigue, and war--against a hoard of invaders, all armed with their own conquering languages, which bit by bit, the speakers of English absorbed and made their own.<BR><BR>Along the way, its colorful story takes in a host of remarkable people, places, and events: the Norman invasion of England in 1066; the arrival of The Canterbury Tales and a "coarse" playwright named William Shakespeare, who added 2,000 words to the language; the songs of slaves; the words of Davy Crockett; and the Lewis and Clark expedition, which led to hundreds of new words as the explorers discovered unknown flora and fauna.<BR><BR>The Adventure of English is an enthralling story not only of power, religion, and trade, but also of a people and how they changed the world.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Melvyn Bragg has written several works of non-fiction (as well as his bestselling novels) including Speak for England, an oral history of the twentieth century; Rich, a biography of Richard Burton; and On Giants' Shoulders, a history of science based on his BBC radio series. He was born in 1939 and educated at Oxford where he read history. He is controller of Arts at LWT and presi- dent of the National Campaign for the Arts. In 1998 he was made a life peer. He lives in London and Cumbria.

He was a carpenter. A visionary. A governor. A prophet. A pioneer. A preacher. A businessman. A temple-builder.<BR><BR>Brigham Young loomed large in a tumultuous time. He helped found the state of Utah in the era of American Manifest Destiny. He rallied thousands around Mormonism, a new faith with powerful detractors who tried to stamp it out in the towns and villages where its communities sprang up. With barely a dozen days of formal education under his belt, he left a legacy of writings, letters and sermons that continue to enrich the study of the Mormon Church and the era of American Western expansion.<BR><BR>In Brigham Young, Ed Breslin distills Young's larger-than-life story into a concise, readable biography that focuses on his most critical moments and achievements. Unlike other biographies, Breslin's account neither whitewashes nor sensationalizes Brigham Young's controversial life. Brigham Young is the perfect primer on Young's vast and complicated legacy.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>The list of Regnery authors reads like a "who's who" of conservative thought, action, and history.

A startling look at the last days of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh draws on new medical and archaeological evidence that suggests that Tutankhamen suffered a brutal, untimely death that led to subsequent palace and political intrigue. 40,000 first printing.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>For decades after the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb, the dazzling treasures found along with the mummy distracted many of us from the actual events of Tutankhamen's life. But take a look at the body itself--cranialX-rays reveal a location on the back of the skull that may indicate a hemorrhage, perhaps one caused by a deliberate blow. The question thus arises: Was King Tut murdered? <BR><BR>Egyptologist Bob Brier specializes in paleopathology, the study of diseases in the ancient world. In essence, he performs high-tech autopsies on 3,000-year-old corpses. (He's also taken part in a re-creation of Egyptian mummification techniques, including the extraction of the brain through the nasal passages.) Here, he examines the X-rays and other photographic evidence, correlating it with the research of other Egyptologists, and concludes that Tutankhamen was the victim of political and religious intrigues that developed into a fatal conspiracy. True crime buffs and historians alike will find much to like in Brier's fast-paced recounting of his investigations. <BR><BR>From School Library Journal<BR>YA-Was Tutankhamen murdered? Brier presents his hypothesis in an engrossing tale that moves along at the pace of a well-crafted whodunit. In lucid prose, he gives the lay person an informative overview of Egyptian history prior to Tutankhamen's reign with special emphasis on his father, Amenhotep IV, who instituted the cult of Aten. As little is known about Tutankhamen's life, Brier reconstructs from wall paintings and hieroglyphic tablets and columns a perfectly plausible and fascinating picture of the boy-pharaoh's friendship with, then marriage to his half-sister Ankhesenamen and their daily life. Before reaching his 20th birthday, Tutankhamen died. His Grand Vizier, Aye, was named pharaoh, Ankhesenamen petitioned her sworn enemies, the Hittites, for a prince to become her consort, and this prince was killed en route to Egypt. A logical case is presented for murder: X rays of Tutankhamen's skull reveal what might be interpreted as a blow to his head; the Grand Vizier who succeeds the childless pharaoh wanted power; Ankhesenamen strangely disappeared after an arranged marriage to his successor. Brier obviously knows his subject and is impassioned by it. Readers who enjoy history or true-crime stories will be intrigued by this work.

Respected Egyptologist Bob Brier, specialist in paleopathology (the study of diseases in the ancient world) and host of the Learning Channel's acclaimed series The Great Egyptians (to be broadcast in May), believes it can. Skillfully combining known historical events with evidence gathered by advanced technologies, Brier has re-created the suspenseful story of religious upheaval and political intrigue that likely resulted in the murder of the teenage king Tutankhamen. The lives and tumultuous times of Tutankhamen and his young bride, Ankhesenamen, are presented in historical context (Brier nicknames chapter 2 "Egypt 101"), providing an elemental understanding of the development of the three great powers of this era: military, priests, and king. Breathing life into old bones and artifacts, Brier examines all available evidence to arrive at "the most reasonable explanation for a tragic event," an explanation that, he says, is testable through the use of current technology on the mummified remains of the ancient king. Grace Fill<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>In his eccentric but entertaining Egyptian Mummies (1994), Brier (Philosophy/C.W. Post Coll.) announced his intention to conduct a mummification of a human cadaver in the ancient manner. Here, after discussing the results of this grisly experiment, Brier uses his knowledge of ancient Egyptian mummification techniques and entombment practices to argue that the young King Tutankhamen (reigned 133323 b.c.) was murdered by his chief vizier, Aye. First Brier puts Tutankhamen's life in historical perspective by reconstructing the turbulent times in which he lived: A scion of the 18th Dynasty, Tutankhamen was the son of the great king Akhenaten, the monotheist who sought to destroy Egypt's traditional polytheistic religion. Succeeding to the throne as a child, Tutankhamen allowed the regent, Aye, to make the practical decisions of governance until he achieved adulthood. The traditional religion was restored, Akhenaten's memory was disgraced, and his religious innovation was branded a heresy. Brier constructs an interesting circumstantial case, through a detailed analysis of autopsies and X-rays of Tutankhamen's mummy, that the young king died as a result of a severe blow to the back of the head. Based on this, he argues that the 19-year-old king was murdered, probably by Aye (Brier excludes the other major suspect, Horemheb, a military hero who later became pharaoh). He also cites some extant correspondence shortly after Tutankhamen's death from Ankhesenamen, Tutankhamen's widow, virtually inviting the Hittites, Egypt's traditional enemy, to take over Egypt to save her from a disastrous marriage. Brier speculates that the prospective husband would have been Aye. In the end, both Ankhesenamen and a Hittite prince who responded to her call died, possibly murdered as Brier speculates, and Aye succeeded as pharaoh. A fascinating blend of ancient history, forensic medicine, and ratiocinative detective work, with a necessarily speculative conclusion. -- Copyright ©1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.<BR><BR>Review<BR>The Murder of Tutankhamen observes the conventions of a whodunit: a compelling victim, a batch of suspects (each of whom might be the killer), a vivid setting, and a climactic gathering wherein an ace detective produces the evidence that indicts the assassin. However, the detective and the story are actual here, and it is largely through forensic evidence and scholarly sleuthing that Bob Brier assembles his persuasive conclusions. -- The Wall Street Journal, Robert Taylor<BR><BR>You may or may not be convinced by his argument that Tutankhamen's death was a murder most foul.... But you will find that Brier has made a persuasive case. More important, by the time you finish his intrigue-filled reconstruction of Tutankhamen's world ... you risk coming to care a good deal about the young pharaoh's fate. -- The New York Times, Richard Bernstein

No period in British history has more resonance and mystery today than the sixteenth century. New Worlds, Lost Worlds brings the atmosphere and events of this great epoch to life. Exploring the underlying religious motivations for the savage violence and turbulence of the period-from Henry VIII's break with Rome to the overwhelming threat of the Spanish Armada-Susan Brigden investigates the actions and influences of such near-mythical figures as Elizabeth I, Thomas More, Bloody Mary, and Sir Walter Raleigh. Authoritative and accessible, New Worlds, Lost Worlds, the latest in the Penguin History of Britain series, provides a superb introduction to one of the most important, compelling, and intriguing periods in the history of the Western world.

Living in peaceful Shady Vale, Shea Ohmsford knew little of the troubles that plagued the rest of the world. Then the giant, forbidding Allanon revaled that the supposedly dead Warlock Lord was plotting to destory the world. The sole weapon against this Power of Darkness was the Sword of Shannara, which could only be used by a true heir of Shannara--Shea being the last of the bloodline, upon whom all hope rested. Soon a Skull Bearer, dread minion of Evil, flew into the Vale, seeking to destroy Shea. To save the Vale, Shea fled, drawing the Skull Bearer after him....

It was his spell that had turned Abernathy into a Wheaten Terrier--though with hands and able to talk.<BR><BR>All went well--until the wizard breathed the magic dust of his spell and suddenly sneezed. Then, where Abernathy had stood, there was only a bottle containing a particularly evil imp. It had been in the collection of Michael Ard Rhi, former King of Landover, now exiled to Earth. Abernathy must now be a part of that collection!<BR><BR>High Lord Ben Holiday set forth for Earth, taking his green but beautiful love, Willow, with him. Unfortunately, they were long in returning. And without the soil in which to root as a tree at times, Willow could not long survive.<BR><BR>That left it up to Questor Thews to save them.

Product Description<BR>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • This cookbook has 101 delicious recipes for home chefs of all abilities.<BR><BR>My name is Alton Brown, and I wrote this book. It’s my first in a few years because I’ve been a little busy with TV stuff and interwebs stuff and live stage show stuff. Sure, I’ve been cooking, but it’s been mostly to feed myself and people in my immediate vicinity—which is really what a cook is supposed to do, right? Well, one day I was sitting around trying to organize my recipes, and I realized that I should put them into a personal collection. One thing led to another, and here’s EveryDayCook. There’s still plenty of science and hopefully some humor in here (my agent says that’s my “wheelhouse”), but unlike in my other books, a lot of attention went into the photos, which were all taken on my iPhone (take that, Instagram) and are suitable for framing. As for the recipes, which are arranged by time of day, they’re pretty darned tasty. Highlights include: <BR> <BR>• Morning: Buttermilk Lassi, Overnight Coconut Oats, Nitrous Pancakes <BR>• Coffee Break: Cold Brew Coffee, Lacquered Bacon, Seedy Date Bars<BR>• Noon: Smoky the Meat Loaf, Grilled Cheese Grilled Sandwich, “EnchiLasagna” or “Lasagnalada”<BR>• Afternoon: Green Grape Cobbler, Crispy Chickpeas, Savory Greek Yogurt Dip<BR>• Evening: Bad Day Bitter Martini, Mussels-O-Miso, Garam Masalmon Steaks<BR>• Anytime: The General’s Fried Chicken, Roasted Chile Salsa, Peach Punch Pops<BR>• Later: Cider House Fondue, Open Sesame Noodles, Chocapocalypse Cookie<BR> <BR>So let’s review: 101 recipes with mouthwatering photos, a plethora of useful insights on methods, tools, and ingredients all written by an “award-winning and influential educator and tastemaker.” That last part is from the PR office. Real people don’t talk like that.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Good Eats 2: The Middle Years picks up where the bestselling Good Eats: The Early Years left off. Showcasing everything Alton Brown fans (and they are legion!) have ever wanted to know about his award-winning television show, The Middle Years is chock-full of behind-the-scenes photographs and trivia, science-of-food information, cooking tips, and--of course--recipes.<BR><BR>Brown's particular genius lies in teaching the chemistry of cooking with levity and exuberance. In episodes such as "Fit to Be Tied" (meat roulades), "Crustacean Nation" (crab), and "Ill-Gotten Grains" (wheat products), Brown explains everything from how to make the perfect omelet to how to stuff your own sausages. With hundreds of entertaining photographs, along with Brown's inimitable line drawings and signature witty writing, this comprehensive companion book conveys the same wildly creative spirit as the show itself. <BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Alton Brown is the writer, director, and host of the Food Network show Good Eats, which won a 2007 Peabody Award, and is the expert commentator on Iron Chef America and host of The Next Iron Chef America. In 2004 his STC book I'm Just Here for the Food won the James Beard Award in the reference category. Brown lives near Atlanta, Georgia, with his wife and daughter.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Alton Brown is a foodie phenomenon: a great cook, a very funny guy, and&#x2015;underneath it all&#x2015;a science geek who's as interested in the chemistry of cooking as he is in eating. (Well, almost.) Here, finally, are the books that Brown's legion of fans have been salivating for&#x2015;two volumes that together will provide an unexpurgated record of his long-running, award-winning Food Network TV series, Good Eats. From "Pork Fiction" (on baby back ribs), to "Citizen Cane" (on caramel sauce), to "Oat Cuisine" (on oatmeal), every hilarious episode is represented. Each book&#x2015;the second will be published in fall 2010&#x2015;is illustrated with behind-the-scenes photos taken on the Good Eats set. Each contains more than 140 recipes and more than 1,000 photographs and illustrations, along with explanations of techniques, lots of food-science information (of course!), and more food puns, food jokes, and food trivia than you can shake a wooden spoon at. <BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Alton Brown is the writer, director, and host of the Food Network show Good Eats, which won a 2007 Peabody Award, and is the expert commentator on Iron Chef America.

Some say your previous cat chooses your new feline. If so, what in cat heaven's name was our beloved Cleo thinking when she sent us a crazy cat like Jonah?<BR><BR>Helen Brown swore she'd never get another cat after her precious Cleo died. But that was before a cute Siamese with an intense blue gaze wrapped her around his paw. Demonstrating the grace of a trapeze artist--and a talent for smashing anything breakable--Jonah seduced the household with his daredevil antics and heart-melting purr.<BR><BR>With her son getting married, her daughter setting off on a potentially dangerous personal quest, and a recent brush with her own mortality, Helen faced a whirlwind of joys and challenges. Yet Jonah proved just the thing to ease the busy household's growing pains. <BR><BR>Uplifting, witty, and wise, here is a story of love and family--four-legged members included. <BR><BR>Don't Miss Helen Brown's Beloved Bestseller, Cleo<BR><BR>"A buoyant tale, heartfelt and open." --Booklist<BR><BR>"An absolute must." --Cat World<BR><BR>"Even non-cat-lovers will be moved." --Good Housekeeping <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR><BR>While working on the manuscript detailing the tragic events surrounding her son's death and the healing her family found through the love of a special cat (Cleo, 2010), Brown is dealt a devastating one-two punch that sends her fragile world reeling. She is diagnosed with breast cancer, and her eldest daughter announces her desire to move to war-torn Sri Lanka and become a Buddhist nun. Feeling uncertain and needy, Brown struggles with the knowledge that she must let Lydia pursue her own dreams, even though, selfishly, she wants to keep her by her side. Although Lydia returns in time to see Brown through her crisis, her compulsion to follow the Buddhist way will test Brown's maternal mettle. Once again, it will take a remarkable feline to help her family put things in perspective and impart the kinds of life lessons one can't always learn from a two-footed guru. Candid, genuine, and unaffected, Brown's touching memoir celebrates the affirmational power of animal companions to help humans navigate life's most challenging moments. --Carol Haggas

Product Description<BR>AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<BR>NAMED A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST <BR>LONGLISTED FOR THE PEN E.O. WILSON LITERARY SCIENCE WRITING AWARD<BR><BR>"Glorious. . .You will marvel at the brilliance and vast weirdness of your design." —The Washington Post <BR><BR>Bill Bryson, bestselling author of A Short History of Nearly Everything, takes us on a head-to-toe tour of the marvel that is the human body. As addictive as it is comprehensive, this is Bryson at his very best, a must-read owner's manual for everybody.<BR><BR>Bill Bryson once again proves himself to be an incomparable companion as he guides us through the human body--how it functions, its remarkable ability to heal itself, and (unfortunately) the ways it can fail. Full of extraordinary facts (your body made a million red blood cells since you started reading this) and irresistible Bryson-esque anecdotes, The Body will lead you to a deeper understanding of the miracle that is life in general and you in particular. As Bill Bryson writes, "We pass our existence within this wobble of flesh and yet take it almost entirely for granted." The Body will cure that indifference with generous doses of wondrous, compulsively readable facts and information.

One of the world's most beloved writers and New York Times bestselling author of A Walk in the Woods and The Body takes his ultimate journey--into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.<BR><BR>In A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail--well, most of it. In A Sunburned Country, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand--and, if possible, answer--the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world's most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. A Short History of Nearly Everything is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.

"Vastly informative and vastly entertaining...A scholarly and fascinating book." -Los Angeles Times<BR><BR>With dazzling wit and astonishing insight, Bill Bryson explores the remarkable history, eccentricities, resilience and sheer fun of the English language. <BR><BR>From the first descent of the larynx into the throat (why you can talk but your dog can't), to the fine lost art of swearing, Bryson tells the fascinating, often uproarious story of an inadequate, second-rate tongue of peasants that developed into one of the world's largest growth industries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Who would have thought that a book about English would be so entertaining? Certainly not this grammar-allergic reviewer, but The Mother Tongue pulls it off admirably. Bill Bryson--a zealot--is the right man for the job. Who else could rhapsodize about "the colorless murmur of the schwa" with a straight face? It is his unflagging enthusiasm, seeping from between every sentence, that carries the book. <BR><BR>Bryson displays an encyclopedic knowledge of his topic, and this inevitably encourages a light tone; the more you know about a subject, the more absurd it becomes. No jokes are necessary, the facts do well enough by themselves, and Bryson supplies tens per page. As well as tossing off gems of fractured English (from a Japanese eraser: "This product will self-destruct in Mother Earth."), Bryson frequently takes time to compare the idiosyncratic tongue with other languages. Not only does this give a laugh (one word: Welsh), and always shed considerable light, it also makes the reader feel fortunate to speak English. <BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Bryson's blend of linguistic anecdotes and Anglo-Saxon cultural history proves entertaining but superficial. "While his historical review is thorough. . . he mostly reiterates conventional views about English's structural superiority," said PW.

"A literate exploration of why we use-or mangle-our native tongue."-USA Today<BR><BR>Bill Bryson celebrates America's magnificent offspring in the book that reveals once and for all how a dusty western hamlet with neither woods nor holly came to be known as Hollywood...and exactly why Mr. Yankee Doodle call his befeathered cap "Macaroni."<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Readers from Toad Suck, Arkansas, to Idiotsville, Oregon--and everywhere in between--will love Made in America, Bill Bryson's Informal History of the English Language in the United States. It is, in a word, fascinating. After reading this tour de force, it's clear that a nation's language speaks volumes about its true character: you are what you speak. Bryson traces America's history through the language of the time, then goes on to discuss words culled from everyday activities: immigration, eating, shopping, advertising, going to the movies, and others. <BR><BR>Made in America will supply you with interesting facts and cocktail chatter for a year or more. Did you know, for example, that Teddy Roosevelt's "speak softly and carry a big stick" credo has its roots in a West African proverb? Or that actor Walter Matthau's given name is Walter Mattaschanskayasky? Or that the supposedly frigid Puritans--who called themselves "Saints," by the way--had something called a pre-contract, which was a license for premarital sex? Made in America is an excellent discussion of American English, but what makes the book such a treasure is that it offers much, much more. <BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Bryson offers a playfully anecdotal account of the etymology of distinctive words and phrases that help to create a distinctly American English. <BR>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Bryson offers a playfully anecdotal account of the etymology of distinctive words and phrases that help to create a distinctly American English. <BR>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>Review<BR>"A treat ... filled with surprises ... a literate exploration ofwhy we use -- or mangle-our native tongue."-- "USA Today""Plain fun ... a terrific book, likely to make its readerschuckle if not guffaw ...

The Pilgrims Progress, by John Bunyan, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: <BR><BR>New introductions commissioned from todays top writers and scholars <BR><BR>Biographies of the authors <BR><BR>Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events <BR><BR>Footnotes and endnotes <BR><BR>Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work <BR><BR>Comments by other famous authors <BR><BR>Study questions to challenge the readers viewpoints and expectations <BR><BR>Bibliographies for further reading <BR><BR>Indices & Glossaries, when appropriateAll editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences-biographical, historical, and literary-to enrich each readers understanding of these enduring works.<BR><BR>Faith, Hope, Mercy, Envy, Ignorance, Guilt: These are not abstract concepts, but the names of vividly imagined, sharply drawn human characters encountered by Christian, the hero of The Pilgrim's Progress. In John Bunyan's seventeenth-century allegory of the soul's search for salvation, each step along the way becomes a dramatic rendering of an inner state of the human psyche. As Christian journeys from "the wilderness of this world" to the glory of the Celestial City, he confronts a seemingly endless array of temptations, threats, and dangers, including the nearly irresistible allure of material splendor at Vanity Fair; the crushing psychological burden of depression and despair in the Slough of Despond; and the fear and uncertainty that eats away at faith in Doubting Castle. <BR><BR>This edition includes both the first and second parts of The Pilgrim's Progress, which collectively reflect the feverish intensity of Bunyan's religious beliefs. What remains significant is Bunyan's ability to transform this intensity into an allegory that speaks to people of all faiths and all eras.<BR><BR>David Hawkes is Associate Professor of English at Lehigh University. His books include Idols of the Marketplace (2001) and Ideology (second edition 2003), and he has contributed articles to The Nation, the Times Literary Supplement, and the Journal of the History of Ideas.

Experience the legend of Tarzan in this thrilling adventure from Edgar Rice Burroughs.<BR><BR>Set amid the vibrant colors and sounds of the African jungle, this classic work, rich in suspense and action, has beckoned generations of readers on a glorious journey to romance and pure adventure. This is the story of the ape-man Tarzan, raised in the wild by the great ape Kala, and how he learns the secrets of the jungle to survive--how to talk with the animals, swing through the trees, and fight the great predators. As Tarzan grows up, he makes many friends, including Tantor the elephant and Numa the lion. When this paradise is invaded by white men, Tarzan's life changes, for in this group is Jane, the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Speaking directly to our childhood fantasies, this exhilarating work takes us to that faraway place in our minds where dreams prevail, and where we too can be masters of our own domain.<BR><BR>With an Introduction by Gore Vidal<BR>And an Afterword by Michael Meyer<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"[Burroughs has] a gift very few writers of any kind possess: he can describe action vividly." -Gore Vidal<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>After serving a short time in the Seventh U.S. Cavalry, Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a shopkeeper, gold miner, cowboy, and policeman before becoming a full-time writer. Tarzan of the Apes (1914) and its twenty-two sequels have sold more than twenty-five million copies in fifty-eight languages. Author of numerous other jungle and science fiction novels and novellas, including The Land That Time Forgot, Burroughs had a writing career that spanned almost thirty years, with his last novel, The Land of Terror, being published in 1941. He died in Tarzana, California, the town named for his legendary hero.<BR><BR>Gore Vidal was the author of numerous novels--the first, Williwaw, written when he was twenty-one--as well as scripts for film, television, and the stage, including the extremely successful The Best Man and Visit to Small Planet. He is perhaps best known for his historical novels, including Burr (1973), 1876 (1976), and Lincoln (1984). He won the National Book Award in 1993 for his book of essays United States (1952-1992).<BR><BR>Michael Meyer, Ph.D., is a professor of English at the University of Connecticut. Among his books, Several More Lives to Live: Thoreau's Political Reputation in America was awarded the Ralph Henry Gabriel Prize by the American Studies Association. In addition to The Bedford Introduction to Literature, his edited volumes include Frederick Douglass: The Narrative and Selected Writings.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>I<BR><BR>Out to Sea<BR><BR>I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.<BR><BR>When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.<BR><BR>I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it may be true.<BR><BR>The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.<BR><BR>If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.<BR><BR>From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi.<BR><BR>The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.<BR><BR>The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.<BR><BR>And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.<BR><BR>Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields-a strong, virile man-mentally, morally, and physically.<BR><BR>In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.<BR><BR>Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.<BR><BR>When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.<BR><BR>For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.<BR><BR>There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.<BR><BR>We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.<BR><BR>A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.<BR><BR>And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.<BR><BR>Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.<BR><BR>The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea-unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.<BR><BR>The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them- a belaying pin and a revolver-nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.<BR><BR>So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.<BR><BR>It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.<BR><BR>Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.<BR><BR>The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.<BR><BR>But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water-pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.<BR><BR>For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.<BR><BR>The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small-a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.<BR><BR>As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.<BR><BR>From scarlet the officer's face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor's heart lodged in the sailor's leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.<BR><BR>Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.<BR><BR>The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.<BR><BR>He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared-England's far-reaching navy.<BR><BR>The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.<BR><BR>Though the fellow's tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.<BR><BR>They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.<BR><BR>They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.<BR><BR>The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.<BR><BR>This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.<BR><BR>There was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that undefinable something which presages disaster. Outwardly, to the knowledge of the Claytons, all went on as before upon the little vessel; but that there was an undertow leading them toward some unknown danger both felt, though they did not speak of it to each other.<BR><BR>On the second day after the wounding of Black Michael, Clayton came on deck just in time to see the limp body of one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate, a heavy belaying pin in his hand, stood glowering at the little party of sullen sailors.<BR><BR>Clayton asked no questions-he did not need to-and the following day, as the great lines of a British battleship grew out of the distant horizon, he half determined to demand that he and Lady Alice be put aboard her, for his fears were steadily increasing that nothing but harm could result from remaining on the lowering, sullen Fuwalda.<BR><BR>Toward noon they were within speaking distance of the British vessel, but when Clayton had nearly decided to ask the captain to put them aboard her, the obvious ridiculousness of such a request became suddenly apparent. What reason could he give the officer commanding her majesty's ship for desiring to go back in the direction from which he had just come!<BR><BR>What if he told them that two insubordinate seamen had been roughly handled by their officers? They would but laugh in their sleeves and attribute his reason for wishing to leave the ship to but one thing-cowardice.<BR><BR>John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, did not ask to be transferred to the British man-of-war. Late in the afternoon he saw her upper works fade below the far horizon, but not before he learned that which confirmed his greatest fears, and caused him to curse the false pride which had restrained him from seeking safety for his young wife a few short hours before, when safety was within reach-a safety which was now gone forever.<BR><BR>It was mid-afternoon that brought the little old sailor, who had been felled by the captain a few days before, to where Clayton and his wife stood by the ship's side watching the ever diminishing outlines of the great battleship. The old fellow was polishing brasses, and as he came edging along until close to Clayton he said, in an undertone:<BR><BR>" 'Ell's to pay, sir, on this 'ere craft, an' mark my word for it, sir. 'Ell's to pay."<BR><BR>"What do you mean, my good fellow?" asked Clayton.<BR><BR>"Wy, hasn't ye seen wats goin' on? Hasn't ye 'eard that devil's spawn of a capting an' 'is mates knockin' the bloomin' lights outen 'arf the crew?<BR><BR>"Two busted 'eads yeste'day, an' three to-day. Black Michael's as good as new agin an' 'e's not the bully to stand fer it, not 'e; an' mark my word for it, sir."<BR><BR>"You mean, my man, that the crew contemplates mutiny?" asked Clayton.<BR><BR>"Mutiny!" exclaimed the old fellow. "Mutiny! They means murder, sir, an mark my word for it, sir."<BR><BR>"When?"<BR><BR>"Hit's comin', sir; hit's comin' but I'm not a-sayin' wen, an' I've said too damned much now, but ye was a good sort t'other day an' I thought it no more'n right to warn ye. But keep a still tongue in yer 'ead an' when ye 'ear shootin' git below an' stay there.<BR><BR>"That's all, only keep a still tongue in yer 'ead, or they'll put a pill between yer ribs, an' mark my word for it, sir," and the old fellow went on with his polishing, which carried him away from where the Claytons were standing.<BR><BR>"Deuced cheerful outlook, Alice," said Clayton.<BR><BR>"You should warn the captain at once, John. Possibly the trouble may yet be averted," she said.<BR><BR>"I suppose I should, but yet from purely selfish motives I am almost prompted to 'keep a still tongue in my 'ead.' Whatever they do now they will spare us in recognition of my stand for this fellow Black Michael, but should they find that I had betrayed them there would be no mercy shown us, Alice."<BR><BR>"You have but one duty, John, and that lies in the interest of vested authority. If you do not warn the captain you are as much a party to whatever follows as though you had helped to plot and carry it out with your own head and hands."<BR><BR>"You do not understand, dear," replied Clayton. "It is of you I am thinking-there lies my first duty. The captain has brought this condition upon himself, so why then should I risk subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in a probably futile attempt to save him from his own brutal folly? You have no conception, dear, of what would follow were this pack of cutthroats to gain control of the Fuwalda."<BR><BR>"Duty is duty, John, and no amount of sophistries may change it. I would be a poor wife for an English lord were I to be responsible for his shirking a plain duty. I realize the danger which must follow, but I can face it with you."<BR><BR>"Have it as you will then, Alice," he answered, smiling. "Maybe we are borrowing trouble. While I do not like the looks of things on board this ship, they may not be so bad after all, for it is possible that the 'Ancient Mariner' was but voicing the desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking of real facts.<BR><BR>"Mutiny on the high sea may have been common a hundred years ago, but in this good year 1888 it is the least likely of happenings.<BR><BR>"But there goes the captain to his cabin now. If I am going to warn him I might as well get the beastly job over for I have little stomach to talk with the brute at all."<BR><BR>So saying he strolled carelessly in the direction of the companionway through which the captain had passed, and a moment later was knocking at his door.<BR><BR>"Come in," growled the deep tones of that surly officer.<BR><BR>And when Clayton had entered, and closed the door behind him:<BR><BR>"Well?"<BR><BR>"I have come to report the gist of a conversation I heard to-day, because I feel that, while there may be nothing to it, it is as well that you be forearmed. In short, the men contemplate mutiny and murder."<BR><BR>"It's a lie!" roared the captain. "And if you have been interfering again with the discipline of this ship, or meddling in affairs that don't concern you you can take the consequences, and be damned. I don't care whether you are an English lord or not. I'm captain of this here ship, and from now on you keep your meddling nose out of my business."<BR><BR>The captain had worked himself up to such a frenzy of rage that he was fairly purple of face, and he shrieked the last words at the top of his voice, emphasizing his remarks by a loud thumping of the table with one huge fist, and shaking the other in Clayton's face.<BR><BR>Greystoke never turned a hair, but stood eying the excited man with level gaze.<BR><BR>"Captain Billings," he drawled finally, "if you will pardon my candor, I might remark that you are something of an ass."<BR><BR>Whereupon he turned and left the captain with the same indifferent ease that was habitual with him, and which was more surely calculated to raise the ire of a man of Billings' class than a torrent of invective.<BR><BR>So, whereas the captain might easily have been brought to regret his hasty speech had Clayton attempted to conciliate him, his temper was now irrevocably set in the mold in which Clayton had left it, and the last chance of their working together for their common good was gone.<BR><BR>"Well, Alice," said Clayton, as he rejoined his wife, "I might have saved my breath. The fellow proved most ungrateful. Fairly jumped at me like a mad dog.<BR><BR>"He and his blasted old ship may hang, for aught I care; and until we are safely off the thing I shall spend my energies in looking after our own welfare. And I rather fancy the first step to that end should be to go to our cabin and look over my revolvers. I am sorry now that we packed the larger guns and the ammunition with the stuff below."<BR><BR>They found their quarters in a bad state of disorder. Clothing from their open boxes and bags strewed the little apartment, and even their beds had been torn to pieces.<BR><BR>"Evidently someone was more anxious about our belongings than we," said Clayton. "Let's have a look around, Alice, and see what's missing."<BR><BR>A thorough search revealed the fact that nothing had been taken but Clayton's two revolvers and the small supply of ammunition he had saved out for them.<BR><BR>"Those are the very things I most wish they had left us," said Clayton, "and the fact that they wished for them and them alone is most sinister."<BR><BR>"What are we to do, John?" asked his wife. "Perhaps you were right in that our best chance lies in maintaining a neutral position.<BR><BR>"If the officers are able to prevent a mutiny, we have nothing to fear, while if the mutineers are victorious our one slim hope lies in not having attempted to thwart or antagonize them."<BR><BR>"Right you are, Alice. We'll keep in the middle of the road."<BR><BR>As they started to straighten up their cabin, Clayton and his wife simultaneously noticed the corner of a piece of paper protruding from beneath the door of their quarters. As Clayton stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move further into the room, and then he realized that it was being pushed inward by someone from without.<BR><BR>Quickly and silently he stepped toward the door, but, as he reached for the knob to throw it open, his wife's hand fell upon his wrist.<BR><BR>"No, John," she whispered. "They do not wish to be seen, and so we cannot afford to see them. Do not forget that we are keeping to the middle of the road."<BR><BR>Clayton smiled and dropped his hand to his side. Thus they stood watching the little bit of white paper until it finally remained at rest upon the floor just inside the door.<BR><BR>Then Clayton stooped and picked it up. It was a bit of grimy, white paper roughly folded into a ragged square. Opening it they found a crude message printed almost illegibly, and with many evidences of an unaccustomed task.<BR><BR>Translated, it was a warning to the Claytons to refrain from reporting the loss of the revolvers, or from repeating what the old sailor had told them-to refrain on pain of death.<BR><BR>"I rather imagine we'll be good," said Clayton with a rueful smile. "About all we can do is to sit tight and wait for whatever may come."

Strictly off limits to the public, Plum Island is home to virginal beaches, cliffs, forests, ponds -- and the deadliest germs that have ever roamed the planet. Lab 257 blows the lid off the stunning true nature and checkered history of Plum Island. It shows that the seemingly bucolic island in the shadow of New York City is a ticking biological time bomb that none of us can safely ignore.<BR><BR>Based on declassified government documents, in-depth interviews, and access to Plum Island itself, this is an eye-opening, suspenseful account of a federal government germ laboratory gone terribly wrong. For the first time, Lab 257 takes you deep inside this secret world and presents startling revelations on virus outbreaks, biological meltdowns, infected workers, the periodic flushing of contaminated raw sewage into area waters, and the insidious connections between Plum Island, Lyme disease, and the deadly West Nile virus. The book also probes what's in store for Plum Island's new owner, the Department of Homeland Security, in this age of bioterrorism.<BR><BR>Lab 257 is a call to action for those concerned with protecting present and future generations from preventable biological catastrophes.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Startling...[Carroll] raises critical questions about the ever-changing balance between science, security and safety...Right on target." -- Popular Science <BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Michael Christopher Carroll spent seven years researching and writing Lab 257.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>New York Times bestseller! A powerful goal-setting and time-management system for anyone trying to organize their lives by the founder of the enormously popular Bullet Journal® planner. <BR><BR>For years Ryder Carroll tried countless organizing systems, online and off, but none of them fit the way his mind worked. Out of sheer necessity, he developed a method called the Bullet Journal that helped him become consistently focused and effective. When he started sharing his system with friends who faced similar challenges, it went viral. Just a few years later, to his astonishment, Bullet Journaling is a global movement. <BR><BR>The Bullet Journal Method is about much more than organizing your notes and to-do lists. It's about what Carroll calls "intentional living": weeding out distractions and focusing your time and energy in pursuit of what's truly meaningful, in both your work and your personal life. It's about spending more time with what you care about, by working on fewer things. His new book shows you how to...<BR><BR>* Track the past: Using nothing more than a pen and paper, create a clear and comprehensive record of your thoughts.<BR><BR>* Order the present: Find daily calm by tackling your to-do list in a more mindful, systematic, and productive way.<BR><BR>* Design the future: Transform your vague curiosities into meaningful goals, and then break those goals into manageable action steps that lead to big change. <BR><BR>Carroll wrote this book for frustrated list-makers, overwhelmed multitaskers, and creatives who need some structure. Whether you've used a Bullet Journal for years or have never seen one before, The Bullet Journal Method will help you go from passenger to pilot of your own life.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Ryder Carroll is a digital product designer and inventor of the Bullet Journal. He's had the privilege of working with companies like Adidas, American Express, Cisco, IBM, Macy's, and HP. He's been featured by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Fast Company, Bloomberg, Lifehacker, and Mashable.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Despite being incredibly popular during his time, Nikola Tesla today remains largely overlooked among lists of the greatest inventors and scientists of the modern era. Thomas Edison gets all the glory for discovering the light bulb, but it was his one-time assistant and lifelong arch nemesis, Tesla, who made the breakthrough in alternating current technology. Edison and Tesla carried on a bitter feud for years, but it was Tesla's AC generators that illuminated the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago; the first time that an event of such magnitude had ever taken place under artificial light. Today, all homes and electrical appliances run on Tesla's AC current.<BR><BR>Born in Croatia in 1856, Tesla spoke eight languages and almost single-handedly developed household electricity. During his life, he patented more than 700 inventions. He invented electrical generators, FM radio, remote control robots, spark plugs and fluorescent lights. He had a photographic memory and did advanced calculus and physics equations in his head.<BR><BR>Nikola Tesla was the ultimate mad scientist. Like many other geniuses throughout history, Tesla was wildly eccentric. He was prone to nervous breakdowns, reported receiving odd visions in the middle of the night, spoke to pigeons, and occasionally thought he was receiving electromagnetic signals from Mars. If he'd lived today, he'd likely be diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder: he hated round objects and disliked numbers that weren't divisible by the three.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Nigel Cawthorne is the author of over a 160 books, from serious political works such as The Iron Cage to lightweight comic romps such as Sex Lives of the Popes. He's well versed in all forms of facts and trivia of the historical, musical, and pop-culture variety, so there is plenty for everyone to enjoy.

The New York Times bestselling coauthor of Gwendy's Button Box brings his signature "thrilling, page-turning" (Michael Koryta, author of How It Happened) prose to this story of small-town evil that combines the storytelling of Stephen King with the true-crime suspense of Michelle McNamara.<BR><BR>In the summer of 1988, the mutilated bodies of several missing girls begin to turn up in a small Maryland town. The grisly evidence leads police to the terrifying assumption that a serial killer is on the loose in the quiet suburb. But soon a rumor begins to spread that the evil stalking local teens is not entirely human. Law enforcement, as well as members of the FBI are certain that the killer is a living, breathing madman-and he's playing games with them. For a once peaceful community trapped in the depths of paranoia and suspicion, it feels like a nightmare that will never end.<BR><BR>Recent college graduate Richard Chizmar returns to his hometown just as a curfew is enacted and a neighborhood watch is formed. In the midst of preparing for his wedding and embarking on a writing career, he soon finds himself thrust into the real-life horror story. Inspired by the terrifying events, Richard writes a personal account of the serial killer's reign of terror, unaware that these events will continue to haunt him for years to come.<BR><BR>A clever, terrifying, and heartrending work of metafiction, Chasing the Boogeyman is the ultimate marriage between horror fiction and true crime. Chizmar's "brilliant...absolutely fascinating, totally compelling, and immediately poignant" (C.J. Tudor, New York Times bestselling author) writing is on full display in this truly unique novel that will haunt you long after you turn the final page.

The word catechism means "instruction" - this book will serve as the standard for all future catechisms.<BR><BR>Using the tradition of explaining what the Church believes (the Creed), what she celebrates (the Sacraments), what she lives (the Commandments), and what she prays (the Lord's Prayer), the Catechism of the Catholic Church offers challenges for believers and answers for all those interested in learning about the mystery of the Catholic faith. <BR><BR>The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a positive, coherent and contemporary map for our spiritual journey toward transformation.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Catechism of the Catholic Church is the first new edition of the catechism in 400 years. Catechism means "instruction," and this text will remain the standard reference for Catholics for many future generations. It is the authoritative summary of Catholic belief regarding the Church creeds, sacraments, commandments, and prayers.

Extensive cross-referencing, indexing, footnotes, and "In Brief" summaries of each section further ease the project of finding the precise answers to any questions a reader might have. Even the layout of information on the page is easy on the eyes, with wide margins for readers who wish to make notes.

All rights reserved.<BR>Chapter One<BR><BR>Man's Capacity for God<BR><BR>I.The Desire for God<BR><BR>27 The desire for God is written in the human heart, because man is created by God and for God; and God never ceases to draw man to himself. Only in God will he find the truth and happiness he never stops searching for:<BR><BR>The dignity of man rests above all on the fact that he is called to communion with God. This invitation to converse with God is addressed to man as soon as he comes into being. For if man exists, it is because God has created him through love, and through love continues to hold him in existence. He cannot live fully according to truth unless he freely acknowledges that love and entrusts himself to his creator.1<BR><BR>28 In many ways, throughout history down to the present day, men have given expression to their quest for God in their religious beliefs and behavior: in their prayers, sacrifices, rituals, meditations, and so forth. These forms of religious expression, despite the ambiguities they often bring with them, are so universal that one may well call man a religious being:<BR><BR>From one ancestor [God] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth, and he allotted the times of their existence and the boundaries of the places where they would live, so that they would search for God and perhaps grope for him and find him--though indeed he is not far from each one of us.<BR><BR>For "in him we live and move and have our being."<BR><BR>29 But this "intimate and vital bond of man to God" (GS 19,1) can be forgotten, overlooked, or even explicitly rejected by man. Such attitudes can have different causes: revolt against evil in the world; religious ignorance or indifference; the cares and riches of this world; the scandal of bad example on the part of believers; currents of thought hostile to religion; finally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.<BR><BR>30 "Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice." Although man can forget God or reject him, He never ceases to call every man to seek him, so as to find life and happiness. But this search for God demands of man every effort of intellect, a sound will, "an upright heart," as well as the witness of others who teach him to seek God.<BR><BR>You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised: great is your power and your wisdom is without measure. And man, so small a part of your creation, wants to praise you: this man, though clothed with mortality and bearing the evidence of sin and the proof that you withstand the proud. Despite everything, man, though but a small a part of your creation, wants to praise you. You yourself encourage him to delight in your praise, for you have made us for yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you.<BR><BR>II.Ways of Coming to Know God<BR><BR>31 Created in God's image and called to know and love him, the person who seeks God discovers certain ways of coming to know him. These are also called proofs for the existence of God, not in the sense of proofs in the natural sciences, but rather in the sense of "converging and convincing arguments," which allow us to attain certainty about the truth.<BR><BR>These "ways" of approaching God from creation have a twofold point of departure: the physical world and the human person.<BR><BR>32 The world: starting from movement, becoming, contingency, and the world's order and beauty, one can come to a knowledge of God as the origin and the end of the universe.<BR><BR>As St. Paul says of the Gentiles: For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made.<BR><BR>And St. Augustine issues this challenge: Question the beauty of the earth, question the beauty of the sea, question the beauty of the air distending and diffusing itself, question the beauty of the sky . . . question all these realities. All respond: "See, we are beautiful." Their beauty is a profession [confessio]. These beauties are subject to change. Who made them if not the Beautiful One [Pulcher] who is not subject to change?<BR><BR>33 The human person: With his openness to truth and beauty, his sense of moral goodness, his freedom and the voice of his conscience, with his longings for the infinite and for happiness, man questions himself about God's existence. In all this he discerns signs of his spiritual soul. The soul, the "seed of eternity we bear in ourselves, irreducible to the merely material," can have its origin only in God.<BR><BR>34 The world, and man, attest that they contain within themselves neither their first principle nor their final end, but rather that they participate in Being itself, which alone is without origin or end. Thus, in different ways, man can come to know that there exists a reality which is the first cause and final end of all things, a reality "that everyone calls 'God.' "<BR><BR>35Man's faculties make him capable of coming to a knowledge of the existence of a personal God. But for man to be able to enter into real intimacy with him, God willed both to reveal himself to man and to give him the grace of being able to welcome this revelation in faith. The proofs of God's existence, however, can predispose one to faith and help one to see that faith is not opposed to reason.<BR><BR>III.The Knowledge of God according to the Church<BR><BR>36 "Our holy mother, the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason." Without this capacity, man would not be able to welcome God's revelation. Man has this capacity because he is created "in the image of God."<BR><BR>37 In the historical conditions in which he finds himself, however, man experiences many difficulties in coming to know God by the light of reason alone:<BR><BR>Though human reason is, strictly speaking, truly capable by its own natural power and light of attaining to a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God, who watches over and controls the world by his providence, and of the natural law written in our hearts by the Creator; yet there are many obstacles which prevent reason from the effective and fruitful use of this inborn faculty. For the truths that concern the relations between God and man wholly transcend the visible order of things, and, if they are translated into human action and influence it, they call for self-surrender and abnegation. The human mind, in its turn, is hampered in the attaining of such truths, not only by the impact of the senses and the imagination, but also by disordered appetites which are the consequences of original sin. So it happens that men in such matters easily persuade themselves that what they would not like to be true is false or at least doubtful.<BR><BR>38 This is why man stands in need of being enlightened by God's revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding, but also "about those religious and moral truths which of themselves are not beyond the grasp of human reason, so that even in the present condition of the human race, they can be known by all men with ease, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error."<BR><BR>IV.How Can We Speak about God?<BR><BR>39 In defending the ability of human reason to know God, the Church is expressing her confidence in the possibility of speaking about him to all men and with all men, and therefore of dialogue with other religions, with philosophy and science, as well as with unbelievers and atheists.<BR><BR>40 Since our knowledge of God is limited, our language about him is equally so. We can name God only by taking creatures as our starting point, and in accordance with our limited human ways of knowing and thinking.<BR><BR>41 All creatures bear a certain resemblance to God, most especially man, created in the image and likeness of God. The manifold perfections of creatures--their truth, their goodness, their beauty--all reflect the infinite perfection of God. Consequently we can name God by taking his creatures' perfections as our starting point, "for from the greatness and beauty of created things comes a corresponding perception of their Creator."<BR><BR>42 God transcends all creatures. We must therefore continually purify our language of everything in it that is limited, imagebound or imperfect, if we are not to confuse our image of God--"the inexpressible, the incomprehensible, the invisible, the ungraspable"--with our human representations. Our human words always fall short of the mystery of God.<BR><BR>43 Admittedly, in speaking about God like this, our language is using human modes of expression; nevertheless it really does attain to God himself, though unable to express him in his infinite simplicity. Likewise, we must recall that "between Creator and creature no similitude can be expressed without implying an even greater dissimilitude"; and that "concerning God, we cannot grasp what he is, but only what he is not, and how other beings stand in relation to him."<BR><BR>IN BRIEF<BR><BR>44 Man is by nature and vocation a religious being. Coming from God, going toward God, man lives a fully human life only if he freely lives by his bond with God.<BR><BR>45 Man is made to live in communion with God in whom he finds happiness: "When I am completely united to you, there will be no more sorrow or trials; entirely full of you, my life will be complete" (St. Augustine, Conf. 10, 28, 39: PL 32, 795).<BR><BR>46 When he listens to the message of creation and to the voice of conscience, man can arrive at certainty about the existence of God, the cause and the end of everything.<BR><BR>47 The Church teaches that the one true God, our Creator and Lord, can be known with certainty from his works, by the natural light of human reason (cf. Vatican Council I, can. 2, ? 1: DS 3026).<BR><BR>48 We really can name God, starting from the manifold perfections of his creatures, which are likenesses of the infinitely perfect God, even if our limited language cannot exhaust the mystery.<BR><BR>49 "Without the Creator, the creature vanishes" (GS 36). This is the reason why believers know that the love of Christ urges them to bring the light of the living God to those who do not know him or who reject him.<BR><BR>Chapter Two<BR><BR>God Comes to Meet Man<BR><BR>50 By natural reason man can know God with certainty, on the basis of his works. But there is another order of knowledge, which man cannot possibly arrive at by his own powers: the order of divine Revelation.1 Through an utterly free decision, God has revealed himself and given himself to man. This he does by revealing the mystery, his plan of loving goodness, formed from all eternity in Christ, for the benefit of all men. God has fully revealed this plan by sending us his beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.<BR><BR>Article 1<BR><BR>THE REVELATION OF GOD<BR><BR>I.God Reveals His "Plan of Loving Goodness"<BR><BR>51 "It pleased God, in his goodness and wisdom, to reveal himself and to make known the mystery of his will. His will was that men should have access to the Father, through Christ, the Word made flesh, in the Holy Spirit, and thus become sharers in the divine nature."<BR><BR>52 God, who "dwells in unapproachable light," wants to communicate his own divine life to the men he freely created, in order to adopt them as his sons in his only-begotten Son. By revealing himself God wishes to make them capable of responding to him, and of knowing him, and of loving him far beyond their own natural capacity.<BR><BR>53 The divine plan of Revelation is realized simultaneously "by deeds and words which are intrinsically bound up with each other" and shed light on each other. It involves a specific divine pedagogy: God communicates himself to man gradually. He prepares him to welcome by stages the supernatural Revelation that is to culminate in the person and mission of the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ.<BR><BR>St. Irenaeus of Lyons repeatedly speaks of this divine pedagogy using the image of God and man becoming accustomed to one another: The Word of God dwelt in man and became the Son of man in order to accustom man to perceive God and to accustom God to dwell in man, according to the Father's pleasure.<BR><BR>II.The Stages of Revelation<BR><BR>In the beginning God makes himself known<BR><BR>54 "God, who creates and conserves all things by his Word, provides men with constant evidence of himself in created realities. And furthermore, wishing to open up the way to heavenly salvation, he mani-fested himself to our first parents from the very beginning." He invited them to intimate communion with himself and clothed them with resplendent grace and justice.<BR><BR>55 This revelation was not broken off by our first parents' sin. "After the fall, [God] buoyed them up with the hope of salvation, by promising redemption; and he has never ceased to show his solicitude for the human race. For he wishes to give eternal life to all those who seek salvation by patience in well-doing."<BR><BR>Even when he disobeyed you and lost your friendship you did not abandon him to the power of death. . . .<BR><BR>Again and again you offered a covenant to man.<BR><BR>The Covenant with Noah<BR><BR>56 After the unity of the human race was shattered by sin God at once sought to save humanity part by part. The covenant with Noah after the flood gives expression to the principle of the divine economy toward the "nations," in other words, toward men grouped "in their lands, each with [its] own language, by their families, in their nations."<BR><BR>57 This state of division into many nations is at once cosmic, social, and religious. It is intended to limit the pride of fallen humanity, united only in its perverse ambition to forge its own unity as at Babel. But, because of sin, both polytheism and the idolatry of the nation and of its rulers constantly threaten this provisional economy with the perversion of paganism.<BR><BR>58 The covenant with Noah remains in force during the times of the Gentiles, until the universal proclamation of the Gospel. The Bible venerates several great figures among the Gentiles: Abel the just, the king-priest Melchizedek--a figure of Christ--and the upright "Noah, Daniel, and Job." Scripture thus expresses the heights of sanctity that can be reached by those who live according to the covenant of Noah, waiting for Christ to "gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad."

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.<BR><BR>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.<BR><BR>Learn how to:<BR><BR>make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);<BR><BR>overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;<BR><BR>design your environment to make success easier;<BR><BR>get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.<BR><BR>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>Wall Street Journal bestseller<BR>USA Today bestseller<BR>Publisher's Weekly bestseller<BR>One of Fast Company's 7 Best Business Books of 2018<BR>One of Business Insider's Best Self-Help Books of 2018<BR><BR>"A supremely practical and useful book.

All rights reserved.<BR><BR>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writ­ing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth- shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable--sometimes it isn't even noticeable--but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here's how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.<BR><BR>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little dif­ference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent. <BR><BR>This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don't seem to matter very much in the moment. If you save a little money now, you're still not a million­aire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you're still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven't learned the language. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines. <BR>Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn't move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss. <BR><BR>But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little ex­cuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It's the accumu­lation of many missteps--1 percent decline here and there--that eventually leads to a problem. <BR><BR>The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff--the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet--but when magni­fied across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.<BR><BR>Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the differ­ence between who you are and who you could be. Success is the prod­uct of daily habits--not once&#8209;in&#8209;a&#8209;lifetime transformations. <BR><BR>That said, it doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your cur­rent trajectory than with your current results. If you're a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you're on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don't change, it's not going to end well. Conversely, if you're broke, but you save a little bit every month, then you're on the path toward financial freedom--even if you're mov­ing slower than you'd like. <BR><BR>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. <BR><BR>If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny bat­tles like these are the ones that will define your future self. <BR><BR>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. <BR><BR>Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.<BR><BR></div

The Challenge:<BR>Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the verybeginning.<BR><BR>But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?<BR><BR>The Study: <BR>For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?<BR><BR>The Standards:<BR>Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.<BR><BR>The Comparisons: <BR>The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good?<BR><BR>Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study. After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness -- why some companies make the leap and others don't.<BR><BR>The Findings:<BR>The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:<BR><BR>Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness. <BR><BR>The Hedgehog Concept: (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence. <BR><BR>A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology. <BR><BR>The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap.<BR><BR>"Some of the key concepts discerned in the study," comments Jim Collins, "fly in the face of our modern business culture and will, quite frankly, upset some people."<BR><BR>Perhaps, but who can afford to ignore these findings?<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Five years ago, Jim Collins asked the question, "Can a good company become a great company and if so, how?" In Good to Great Collins, the author of Built to Last, concludes that it is possible, but finds there are no silver bullets. Collins and his team of researchers began their quest by sorting through a list of 1,435 companies, looking for those that made substantial improvements in their performance over time. They finally settled on 11--including Fannie Mae, Gillette, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo--and discovered common traits that challenged many of the conventional notions of corporate success. Making the transition from good to great doesn't require a high-profile CEO, the latest technology, innovative change management, or even a fine-tuned business strategy. At the heart of those rare and truly great companies was a corporate culture that rigorously found and promoted disciplined people to think and act in a disciplined manner. Peppered with dozens of stories and examples from the great and not so great, the book offers a well-reasoned road map to excellence that any organization would do well to consider. Like Built to Last, Good to Great is one of those books that managers and CEOs will be reading and rereading for years to come. --Harry C. Edwards<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>In what Collins terms a prequel to the bestseller Built to Last he wrote with Jerry Porras, this worthwhile effort explores the way good organizations can be turned into ones that produce great, sustained results. To find the keys to greatness, Collins's 21-person research team (at his management research firm) read and coded 6,000 articles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts and created 384 megabytes of computer data in a five-year project. That Collins is able to distill the findings into a cogent, well-argued and instructive guide is a testament to his writing skills. After establishing a definition of a good-to-great transition that involves a 10-year fallow period followed by 15 years of increased profits, Collins's crew combed through every company that has made the Fortune 500 (approximately 1,400) and found 11 that met their criteria, including Walgreens, Kimberly Clark and Circuit City. At the heart of the findings about these companies' stellar successes is what Collins calls the Hedgehog Concept, a product or service that leads a company to outshine all worldwide competitors, that drives a company's economic engine and that a company is passionate about. While the companies that achieved greatness were all in different industries, each engaged in versions of Collins's strategies. While some of the overall findings are counterintuitive (e.g., the most effective leaders are humble and strong-willed rather than outgoing), many of Collins's perspectives on running a business are amazingly simple and commonsense. This is not to suggest, however, that executives at all levels wouldn't benefit from reading this book; after all, only 11 companies managed to figure out how to change their B grade to an A on their own. <BR><BR>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc. <BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>Collins is coauthor of Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies (1994), the widely heralded book that was the result of a six-year research project conducted by Collins and Jerry Porras. They identified 18 companies that met their rigorous standard for long-term performance. They looked for companies that had outperformed the stock market by a factor of 15 starting from 1926. Then they went about the task of identifying what these companies had in common. Now Collins turns his attention to companies that have made the transition from "good to great." This time the findings are backed by five years of research and data analysis. Starting with every company that ever appeared in the Fortune 500, Collins identifies 11 companies that had 15-year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market when, after a transition point, they then demonstrated cumulative returns of at least three times the market over the next 15 years. Collins then looked for similarities among the companies. What he found would both surprise and fascinate anyone involved in management. David Rouse<BR>Copyright © American Library Association.

On being awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1986, Copland was praised for his "uniquely American music that reflects the very soul and experience of our people." During his career, Copland taught composition at Harvard and the Berkshire Music Center, lectured all over the United States, and wrote Our New Music and Music and Imagination. He died in 1990.

Offering "the hows and whys of successful cooking," Cookwise, by well-known food writer and culinary sleuth Shirley O. Corriher, tells you how and why things happen in the course of food preparation. The more than 230 outstanding recipes featured not only please the palate, but demonstrate the various roles of ingredients and techniques--making Cookwise an invaluable reference for anyone who has ever wanted to improve on a recipe, make a cake moister, or a roast chicken juicier.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Is it safe to let a biochemist into your kitchen? If it's Shirley Corriher, extend an open invitation. Her long-awaited book, Cookwise, is a unique combination of basic cooking know-how, excellent recipes--from apple pie to beurre blanc--and reference source. She makes the science of cooking entirely comprehensible, then livens it up with stories, such as when her first roast duck blew up because she overstuffed it and the fat from the bird caused it to expand beyond capacity. Food companies pay Corriher fancy fees to troubleshoot their recipes, and Cookwise puts her encyclopedic knowledge ever at your fingertips. If you want to know how to make the flakiest pastry, best-textured breads, delicious fruit desserts from fruit that's not fully ripe, impeccable sauces, and attractively bright cooked vegetables, this book contains the answers. "What this recipe shows" tells you up front what's useful in each of the book's 230-plus recipes. "At-a-glance," "What to do," and "Why" help you learn or troubleshoot in minutes. If eight steps to a perfect Juicy Roast Chicken are daunting, think of the delight of Rich Cappuccino Ice Cream in three steps or the seductive Secret Marquise in five.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Corriher is a well-known culinary consultant and problem solver whose answers to kitchen mysteries have appeared in many food publications. Now she has set down some of her vast knowledge in this big, wide-ranging reference/cookbook. In seven basic chapters, from The Wonder of Risen Bread to Sweet Thoughts and Chocolate Dreams, she explains why recipes work, what to do when they don't, and how to make them even better (anyone who's ever wondered why the same cake recipe always tastes better when her neighbor makes it will find out the probable reasons why). More than 200 recipes interspersed throughout demonstrate Corriher's explorations and explanations. Also included are At a Glance charts for easy reference (e.g., Finetuning Cookies), trouble-shooting charts (Yeast Bread Problems), charts on the basics (Whipped Cream: What To Do and Why), and dozens more. Although the recipes are delicious?and surely foolproof?this unique work will be far more valuable as a reference than as a cookbook. Highly recommended.<BR>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>At some time, every chef has been perplexed by a cookie inexplicably spreading all over a baking sheet or a pie with an uncuttable crust. Why does this happen even though the cook scrupulously followed a tested, reliable recipe? Corriher comprehensively details cooking and baking techniques in a cookbook that is much more than a compendium of recipes. She knows exactly why that cookie spreads, because she understands the physics of butter and other fats, and she shares her knowledge usefully with home and professional cooks. Corriher applies her astounding food science to all aspects of the baker's art: biscuits, pies, cakes, and breads. In addition, eggs, meats, and sauces receive her probing analyses of what goes awry in the kitchen and how to remedy it. Anecdotes leaven what might otherwise be dull, dry text. Her command of contemporary nutritional science yields useful tables of comparative data. This book answers so many cooking questions that it is utterly indispensable to any cookery reference collection. Mark Knoblauch<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR><BR>Can you tell whether a recipe will work before you cook it? You can if you really know what's cooking.<BR><BR>In the long-awaited CookWise, food sleuth Shirley Corriher tells you how and why things happen in cooking. When you know how to estimate the right amount of baking powder, you can tell by looking at the recipe that the cake is overleavened and may fall. When you know that too little liquid for the amount of chocolate in a recipe can cause the chocolate to seize and become a solid grainy mass, you can spot chocolate truffle recipes that will be a disaster. And, in both cases, you know exactly how to "fix" the recipe. Knowing how ingredients work, individually and in combination, will not only make you more aware of the cooking process, but transform you into a confident and exceptional cook -- a cook who is in control.<BR><BR>CookWise is a different kind of cookbook. There are over 230 outstanding recipes -- from Snapper Fingers with Smoked Pepper Tartar Sauce to Chocolate Stonehenge Slabs with Cappuccino Mousse -- but here each recipe serves not only to please the palate but to demonstrate the roles of ingredients and techniques. A What This Recipe Shows section summarizes the special cooking points being demonstrated in each recipe. This little bit of science in everyday language indicates which steps or ingredients are vital and cannot be omitted without consequences.<BR><BR>Among the recipes you'll also find some surprises. Don't be afraid of a vinaigrette prepared without vinegar or a high-egg-white, crisp pÃ¢te Ã¢ choux. Many of the concepts used here are Shirley's own. Try her method of sprinkling croissant or puff pastry dough with ice water before folding to keep it soft and easy to roll.<BR><BR>CookWise covers everything from the rise and fall of cakes, through unscrambling the powers of eggs and why red cabbage turns blue during cooking but red peppers don't, to the essential role of crystals in making fudge. Want to learn about what makes a crust flaky? Try the Big-Chunk Fresh Apple Pie in Flaky cheese Crust. Discover for yourself what brining does to poultry in Juicy Roast Chicken.<BR><BR>No matter what your cooking level, you'll find CookWise a revelation. Different people will use CookWise in different ways:<BR><BR>Home cooks will value CookWise as a collection of extraordinarily good recipes.<BR><BR>The busy chef can use CookWise as a reference book to look up and solve problems. Major headings are shown in the Contents and 42 At-a-Glance summary charts make problem solving quick and easy<BR><BR>Beginning cooks can use CookWise as a howto book with easy-to-follow recipes that produce dishes looking and tasting like the work of an experienced chef.<BR><BR>Food writers and test-kitchen chefs who are developing recipes can find the formulas and tips for successful recipes,<BR><BR>Anyone who wants to improve a recipe can use CookWise as a guide. Here is how to make cakes moister, a pate A choux drier and crisper, a dish lighter or darker in color; how to make muffins peak better, cookies spread less, or a roast chicken juicier.<BR><BR>Everyone who cooks needs to be able to spot bad recipes and save the time, money, and frustration that they cause. Many of the At-a-Glance charts point out specific problems.<BR><BR>CookWise is not only informative, it's engrossing, and many sections react like a mystery story. The knowledge you gain from its pages will transform you, too, into a food sleuth, an informed and assured cook who can track down why sauces curdle or why the muffins were dry -- a cook who will never prepare a failed recipe again! <BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Shirley O.

Can't decide what to read? Imagine a list of the greatest books described in concise, insightful and witty profiles to browse in search of the next perfect read. 2002 Great Books for Every Book Lover offers all this and more, reviewing each book with the wit and wisdom of a seasoned book critic in this unique and useful reference that belongs in every bibliophile's library. * Readers will love the broad selection of titles, learning about famous authors and finding or recommending the next perfect read for themselves, friends and family--every type of book is covered. * Each of the 2002 book profiles, roughly one paragraph long, gives a short summary, historical context, information about the author, why the book was important and other recommended reads by the same author. * Indexes make it easy to find books by subject, title or author. A tear-off list gives readers a handy in-store reference and a check-off list helps track all the books they've read.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>This book was originally published from 1994 to 1997 as a series of one-year calendars. Those materials were reassembled and some new material added to make this book. The result is an annotated list of 2002 books, arranged in 70 subject areas such as "First-Class Fiction" and "Holiday Reading," with title and author indexes. As must be expected with such compilations, there will be disagreement about inclusions. Ogden Nash and John Keats are in, but Edward Lear and Percy Shelley are out. Henry Fielding's Tom Jones is not included with the "British Classics," but five novels by Charles Dickens are. The annotations are glib and sometimes not informative; one would not guess from the annotation that Mark Leyner's Et Tu, Babe (Vintage, 1993. reprint) is frequently scatological as well as hilarious. Both Good Reading (LJ 11/15/89) and The Reader's Adviser (1986) are more costly than this innocuous compilation, but they are much more comprehensive, better annotated, and of greater service to libraries.?Peter A.

All rights reserved.<BR>Airframe Chapter 3<BR><BR>LAX<BR>5:57 a.m.<BR><BR>Daniel Greene was the duty officer at the FAA Flight Standards District Office on Imperial Highway, half a mile from LAX. The local FSDOs--or Fizdos, as they were called--supervised the flight operations of commercial carriers, checking everything from aircraft maintenance to pilot training. Greene had come in early to clear the paper off his desk; his secretary had quit the week before, and the office manager refused to replace her, citing orders from Washington to absorb attrition. So now Greene went to work, muttering. Congress was slashing the FAA budget, telling them to do more with less, pretending the problem was productivity and not workload. But passenger traffic was up four percent a year, and the commercial fleet wasn't getting younger. The combination made for a lot more work on the ground. Of course, the FSDOs weren't the only ones who were strapped. Even the NTSB was broke; the Safety Board only got a million dollars a year for aircraft accidents, and--<BR><BR>The red phone on his desk rang, the emergency line. He picked it up; it was a woman at traffic control.<BR><BR>"We've just been informed of an incident on an inbound foreign carrier," she said.<BR><BR>"Uh-huh." Greene reached for a notepad. "Incident" had a specific meaning to the FAA, referring to the lower category of flight problems that carriers were required to report. "Accidents" involved deaths or structural damage to the aircraft and were always serious, but with incidents, you never knew. "Go ahead."<BR><BR>"It's TransPacific Flight 545, incoming from Hong Kong to Denver. Pilot's requested emergency landing at LAX. Says they encountered turbulence during flight."<BR><BR>"Is the plane airworthy?"<BR><BR>"They say it is," Levine said. "They've got injuries, and they've requested forty ambulances."<BR><BR>"Forty?"<BR><BR>"They've also got two stiffs."<BR><BR>"Great." Greene got up from his desk. "When's it due in?"<BR><BR>"Eighteen minutes."<BR><BR>"Eighteen minutes--Jeez, why am I getting this so late?"<BR><BR>"Hey, the captain just told us, we're telling you. I've notified EMS and alerted the fire crews."<BR><BR>"Fire crews? I thought you said the plane's okay."<BR><BR>"Who knows?" the woman said. "The pilot is not making much sense. Sounds like he might be in shock. We hand off to the tower in seven minutes."<BR><BR>"Okay," Greene said. "I'm on my way."<BR><BR>He grabbed his badge and his cell phone and went out the door. As he passed Karen, the receptionist, he said, "Have we got anybody at the international terminal?"<BR><BR>"Kevin's there."<BR><BR>"Beep him," Greene said. "Tell him to get on TPA 545, inbound Hong Kong, landing in fifteen. Tell him to stay at the gate--and don't let the flight crew leave."<BR><BR>"Got it," she said, reaching for the phone.<BR><BR>Greene roared down Sepulveda Boulevard toward the airport. Just before the highway ran beneath the runway, he looked up and saw the big TransPacific Airlines widebody, identifiable by its bright yellow tail insignia, taxiing toward the gate. TransPacific was a Hong Kong-based charter carrier. Most of the problems the FAA had with foreign airlines occurred with charters. Many were low-budget operators that didn't match the rigorous safety standards of the scheduled carriers. But TransPacific had an excellent reputation.<BR><BR>At least the bird was on the ground, Greene thought. And he couldn't see any structural damage to the widebody. The plane was an N-22, built by Norton Aircraft in Burbank. The plane had been in revenue service five years, with an enviable dispatch and safety record.<BR><BR>Greene stepped on the gas and rushed into the tunnel, passing beneath the giant aircraft.<BR><BR>He sprinted through the international building. Through the windows, he saw the TransPacific jet pulled up to the gate, and the ambulances lined up on the concrete below. The first of them was already driving out, its siren whining.<BR><BR>Greene came to the gate, flashed his badge, and ran down the ramp. Passengers were disembarking, pale and frightened. Many limped, their clothes torn and bloody. On each side of the ramp, paramedics clustered around the injured.<BR><BR>As he neared the plane, the nauseating odor of vomit grew stronger. A frightened TransPac stewardess pushed him back at the door, chattering at him rapidly in Chinese. He showed her his badge and said, "FAA! Official business! FAA!" The stewardess stepped back, and Greene slid past a mother clutching an infant and stepped into the plane.<BR><BR>He looked at the interior, and stopped. "Oh my God," he said softly. "What happened to this plane?"<BR><BR>From the Hardcover edition.

All rights reserved.<BR>Actually, I was sitting on my bed in my apartment in Culver City, watching the Lakers game with the sound turned off, while I tried to study vocabulary for my introductory Japanese class.<BR><BR>It was a quiet evening; I had gotten my daughter to sleep about eight. Now I had the cassette player on the bed, and the cheerful woman's voice was saying things like, "Hello, I am a police officer. Can I be of assistance?" and "Please show me the menu." After each sentence, she paused for me to repeat it back, in Japanese. I stumbled along as best I could. Then she would say, "The vegetable store is closed. Where is the post office?" Things like that. Sometimes it was hard to concentrate, but I was trying. "Mr. Hayashi has two children."<BR><BR>I tried to answer. "Hayashi-san wa kodomo ga fur&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;futur&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;." I swore. But by then the woman was talking again.<BR><BR>"This drink is not very good at all."<BR><BR>I had my textbook open on the bed, alongside a Mr. Potato Head I'd put back together for my daughter. Next to that, a photo album, and the pictures from her second birthday party. It was four months after Michelle's party, but I still hadn't put the pictures in the album. You have to try and keep up with that stuff.<BR><BR>"There will be a meeting at two o'clock."<BR><BR>The pictures on my bed didn't reflect reality any more. Four months later, Michelle looked completely different. She was taller; she'd outgrown the expensive party dress my ex-wife had bought for her: black velvet with a white lace collar.<BR><BR>In the photos, my ex-wife plays a prominent role--holding the cake as Michelle blows out the candles, helping her unwrap the presents. She looks like a dedicated mom. Actually, my daughter lives with me, and my ex-wife doesn't see much of her. She doesn't show up for weekend visitation half the time, and she misses child-support payments.<BR><BR>But you'd never know from the birthday photos.<BR><BR>"Where is the toilet?"<BR><BR>"I have a car. We can go together."<BR><BR>I continued studying. Of course, officially I was on duty that night: I was the Special Services officer on call for division headquarters downtown. But February ninth was a quiet Thursday, and I didn't expect much action. Until nine o'clock, I only had three calls.<BR><BR>Special Services includes the diplomatic section of the police department; we handle problems with diplomats and celebrities, and provide translators and liaison for foreign nationals who come into contact with the police for one reason or another. It's varied work, but not stressful: when I'm on call I can expect a half-dozen requests for help, none of them emergencies. I hardly ever have to roll out. It's much less demanding than being a police press liaison, which is what I did before Special Services.<BR><BR>Anyway, on the night of February ninth, the first call I got concerned Fernando Conseca, the Chilean vice-consul. A patrol car had pulled him over; Ferny was too drunk to drive, but he was claiming diplomatic immunity. I told the patrolmen to drive him home, and I made a note to complain to the consulate again in the morning.<BR><BR>Then an hour later, I got a call from detectives in Gardena. They'd arrested a suspect in a restaurant shooting who spoke only Samoan, and they wanted a translator. I said I could get one, but that Samoans invariably spoke English; the country had been an American trust territory for years. The detectives said they'd handle it. Then I got a call that mobile television vans were blocking fire lanes at the Aerosmith concert; I told the officers to give it to the fire department. And it was quiet for the next hour. I went back to my textbook and my sing-song woman saying things like, "Yesterday's weather was rainy."<BR><BR>Then Tom Graham called.<BR><BR>"It's the fucking Japs," Graham said. "I can't believe they're pulling this shit. Better get over here, Petey-san. Eleven hundred Figueroa, corner of Seventh. It's the new Nakamoto building."<BR><BR>"What is the problem?" I had to ask. Graham is a good detective but he has a bad temper, and he tends to blow things out of proportion.<BR><BR>"The problem," Graham said, "is that the fucking Japs are demanding to see the fucking Special Services liaison. Which is you, buddy. They're saying the police can't proceed until the liaison gets here."<BR><BR>"Can't proceed? Why? What have you got?"<BR><BR>"Homicide," Graham said. "Caucasian female approximately twenty-five years old, apparent six-oh-one. Lying flat on her back, right in their damn boardroom. Quite a sight. You better get down here as soon as you can."<BR><BR>I said, "Is that music in the background?"<BR><BR>"Hell, yes," Graham said. "There's a big party going on. Tonight is the grand opening of the Nakamoto Tower, and they're having a reception. Just get down here, will you?"<BR><BR>I said I would. I called Mrs. Ascenio next door, and asked her if she would watch the baby while I was gone; she always needed extra money. While I waited for her to arrive I changed my shirt and put on my good suit. Then Fred Hoffmann called. He was watch commander at DHD downtown; a short, tough guy with gray hair. "Listen, Pete. I think you might want help on this one."<BR><BR>I said, "Why is that?"<BR><BR>"Sounds like we got a homicide involving Japanese nationals. It may be sticky. How long have you been a liaison?"<BR><BR>"About six months," I said.<BR><BR>"If I was you, I'd get some experienced help. Pick up Connor and take him downtown with you."<BR><BR>"Who?"<BR><BR>"John Connor. Ever heard of him?"<BR><BR>"Sure," I said. Everyone in the division had heard of Connor. He was a legend, the most knowledgeable of the Special Services officers. "But isn't he retired?"<BR><BR>"He's on indefinite leave, but he still works cases involving the Japanese. I think he could be helpful to you. Tell you what. I'll call him for you. You just go down and pick him up." Hoffmann gave me his address.<BR><BR>"Okay, fine. Thanks."<BR><BR>"And one other thing. Land lines on this one, okay, Pete?"<BR><BR>"Okay," I said. "Who requested that?"<BR><BR>"It's just better."<BR><BR>"Whatever you say, Fred."<BR><BR>Land lines meant to stay off the radios, so our transmissions wouldn't be picked up by the media monitoring police frequencies. It was standard procedure in certain situations. Whenever Elizabeth Taylor went to the hospital, we went to land lines. Or if the teenage son of somebody famous died in a car crash, we'd go to land lines to make sure the parents got the news before the TV crews started banging on their door. We used land lines for that kind of thing. I'd never heard it invoked in a homicide before.<BR><BR>But driving downtown, I stayed off the car phone, and listened to the radio. There was a report of a shooting of a three-year-old boy who was now paralyzed from the waist down. The child was a bystander during a 7-Eleven robbery. A stray bullet hit him in the spine and he was--<BR><BR>I switched to another station, got a talk show. Ahead, I could see the lights of the downtown skyscrapers, rising into mist. I got off the freeway at San Pedro, Connor's exit.<BR><BR>What I knew about John Connor was that he had lived for a time in Japan, where he acquired his knowledge of Japanese language and culture. At one point, back in the 1960s, he was the only officer who spoke fluent Japanese, even though Los Angeles then had the largest Japanese population outside the home islands.<BR><BR>Now, of course, the department has more than eighty officers who speak Japanese--and more, like me, who are trying to learn. Connor had retired several years before. But the liaison officers who worked with him agreed he was the best. He was said to work very fast, often solving cases in a few hours. He had a reputation as a skilled detective and an extraordinary interviewer, able to get information from witnesses like nobody else. But most of all, the other liaisons praised his even-handed approach. One said to me, "Working with the Japanese is like balancing on a tightrope. Sooner or later, everybody falls off on one side or the other. Some people decide the Japanese are fabulous and can do no wrong. Some people decide they're vicious pricks. But Connor always keeps his balance. He stays in the middle. He always knows exactly what he is doing."<BR><BR>John Connor lived in the industrial area off Seventh Street, in a large brick warehouse alongside a diesel truck depot. The freight elevator in the building was broken. I walked upstairs to the third floor and knocked on his door.<BR><BR>"It's open," a voice said.<BR><BR>I entered a small apartment. The living room was empty, and furnished in the Japanese style: tatami mats, shoji screens, and wood-paneled walls. A calligraphy scroll, a black lacquer table, a vase with a single splash of white orchid.<BR><BR>I saw two pairs of shoes set out beside the door. One was a man's brogues. The other was a pair of women's high heels.<BR><BR>I said, "Captain Connor?"<BR><BR>"Just a minute."<BR><BR>A shoji screen slid back and Connor appeared. He was surprisingly tall, maybe a hundred and ninety centimeters, well over six feet. He wore a yukata, a light Japanese robe of blue cotton. I estimated he was fifty-five years old. Broad-shouldered, balding, with a trim mustache, sharp features, piercing eyes. Deep voice. Calm.<BR><BR>"Good evening, Lieutenant."<BR><BR>We shook hands. Connor looked me up and down,...

Computer manufacturing is--after cars, energy production and illegal drugs--the largest industry in the world, and it's one of the last great success stories in American business. Accidental Empires is the trenchant, vastly readable history of that industry, focusing as much on the astoundingly odd personalities at its core--Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mitch Kapor, etc. and the hacker culture they spawned as it does on the remarkable technology they created. Cringely reveals the manias and foibles of these men (they are always men) with deadpan hilarity and cogently demonstrates how their neuroses have shaped the computer business. But Cringely gives us much more than high-tech voyeurism and insider gossip. From the birth of the transistor to the mid-life crisis of the computer industry, he spins a sweeping, uniquely American saga of creativity and ego that is at once uproarious, shocking and inspiring. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>Robert X. Cringely manages to capture the contradictions and everyday insanity of computer industry empire building, while at the same time chipping away sardonically at the PR campaigns that have built up some very common businesspeople into the household gods of geekdom. Despite some chuckles at the expense of all things nerdy, white, and male in the computer industry, Cringely somehow manages to balance the humor with a genuine appreciation of both the technical and strategic accomplishments of these industry luminaries. Whether you're a hard-boiled Silicon Valley marketing exec fishing for an IPO or just a plain old reader with an interest in business history and anecdotal storytelling, there's something to enjoy here.<BR><BR>Review<BR>"The title is an inspiration, and Cringely's whimsical, matter of fact style--an attribute altogether missing in the urgent, go-go lifestyles of the people he writes about--makes the book itself worth reading.

The best book on the subject so far."-- "New York Daily News""A fascinating book . . . well worth the time."-- "Sacramento Bee"As compelling and entertaining read as "Barbarians at the Gate."-- Roger von Oech<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR>Computer manufacturing is-- after cars, energy production and illegal drugs-- the largest industry in the world, and it's one of the last great success stories in American business.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>In March, 1945, the U.S. War Department issued a restricted document called Handbook on German Military Forces. The restricted classification was removed in 1953, but the handbook has until now remained virtually unknown. The book is a massive compendium of information on every aspect of Hitler's forces. It gives credence to the contention that by 1945 U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall may have known more about the German military than did Hitler himself.<BR><BR>Exceptionally well organized and exhaustively detailed, the handbook examines German military personnel from the lowest levels to the High Command. It describes the Wehrmacht's administrative structure, unit organization, field tactics, fortification and defense systems, weapons and other equipment, and uniforms and insignia. Moreover, it presents this abundance of information in a manner that is remarkable for its depth and clarity.<BR><BR>The book contains an astute analysis of the psychology of the German soldier and charts the ways in which the attitudes of Hitler's men changed over the course of the war. It also considers the strengths and weaknesses of the German weapons systems, describes how Allied soldiers could make use of captured weapons, and offers advice on how Allied military personnel might avoid being captured themselves. Hundreds of tables, organizational charts, and illustrations, some in color, add further value to the book.<BR><BR>Handbook on German Military Forces will prove indispensable to scholars of World War II as well as to all devotees of military history.<BR><BR>Book Description:<BR><BR>With an Introduction by Stephen E. Ambrose

Library of America launches a definitive collected edition of one of the most original and electric writers of our time with a volume gathering her five iconic books of the 1960s & 70s<BR><BR>Joan Didion's influence on postwar American letters is undeniable. Whether writing fiction, memoir, or trailblazing journalism, her gifts for narrative and dialogue, and her intimate but detached authorial persona, have won her legions of readers and admirers. Now Library of America launches its multi-volume edition of Didion's collected writings, prepared in consultation with the author, that brings together her fiction and nonfiction for the first time. Collected in this first volume are Didion's five iconic books from the 1960s and 1970s: Run River, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, Play It As It Lays, A Book of Common Prayer, and The White Album. Whether writing about countercultural San Francisco, the Las Vegas wedding industry, Lucille Miller, Charles Manson, or the shopping mall, Didion achieves a wonderful negative sublimity without condemning her subjects or condescending to her readers. Chiefly about California, these books display Didion's genius for finding exactly the right language and tone to capture America's broken twilight landscape at a moment of headlong conflict and change.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Almost any page of this invaluable book will take you somewhere emotionally and offer a paramount lesson in the power of Didion's voice." -- Hilton Als, The New Yorker<BR><BR>"Readers carry Didion around in different ways, for different moments, and this new book is a defining compilation of her early writing." --Los Angeles Times<BR><BR>"The Library of America has another gem on its hands with this collection." --PopMatters<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Joan Didion (1934--2021) was one of the most distinct American literary voices of the last half century. She was the author of five novels and ten books of nonfiction, including Slouching Towards Bethlehem, The White Album, Play It As It Lays, and mostly recently the New York Times best sellers The Year of Magical Thinking, Blue Nights, South and West, and Let Me tell You What I Mean. She was the recipient of numerous awards, including the National Book Award for Nonfiction and the National Book Foundations' Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.<BR><BR>David L.

#1 New York Times Bestseller<BR><BR>Legendary venture capitalist John Doerr reveals how the goal-setting system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) has helped tech giants from Intel to Google achieve explosive growth--and how it can help any organization thrive. <BR><BR>In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-up whom he'd just given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress--to measure what mattered.<BR><BR>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove ("the greatest manager of his or any era") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<BR><BR>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <BR><BR>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<BR><BR>In Measure What Matters, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"I'd recommend John's book for anyone interested in becoming a better manager." <BR>--Bill Gates<BR><BR>"Whether you're a seasoned CEO or a first-time entrepreneur, you'll find valuable lessons, tools, and inspiration in the pages of Measure What Matters. I'm glad John invested the time to share these ideas with the world."<BR>--Reid Hoffman, cofounder of LinkedIn and author of The Start-up of You<BR><BR>"Measure What Matters deserves to be fully embraced by every person responsible for performance, in any walk of life. John Doerr makes Andy Grove a mentor to us all. If every team, leader, and individual applied OKRs with rigor and imagination, all sectors of society could see an exponential increase in productivity and innovation." <BR>--Jim Collins, author of Good to Great<BR><BR>"John Doerr has taught a generation of entrepreneurs and philanthropists that execution is everything. Measure What Matters shows how any organization or team can aim high, move fast, and excel."<BR>--Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and founder of LeanIn.org and OptionB.org<BR><BR>"In this indispensable book, the most important venture capitalist of our era reveals a key to business innovation and success. This crisp and colorful book combines fascinating case studies with insightful personal stories to show how OKRs can add magic to organizations of any size."<BR>--Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci<BR><BR>"I'm a big believer in John Doerr's simple yet effective OKR system--I've seen it work firsthand! I encourage every business leader to read Measure What Matters in order to learn some real and practical secrets for success."<BR>--Anne Wojcicki, founder and CEO of 23andMe<BR><BR>"John Doerr has been the source of management magic for many of the most iconic companies in Silicon Valley that went on to change the world. Measure What Matters is a must read for anyone motivated to improve their organization."<BR>--Former Vice President Al Gore <BR><BR>"Measure What Matters takes you behind the scenes for the creation of Intel's powerful OKR system--one of Andy Grove's finest legacies."<BR>--Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel<BR><BR>"Measure What Matters will transform your approach to setting goals for yourself and your organization. John Doerr pushes every leader to think deeply about creating a focused, purpose-driven business environment." <BR>--Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments<BR><BR>"John Doerr is a Silicon Valley legend. He explains how transparently setting objectives and defining key results can align organizations and motivate high performance."<BR>--Jonathan Levin, dean of Stanford Graduate School of Business<BR><BR>"Measure What Matters is a gift to every leader or entrepreneur who wants a more transparent, accountable, and effective team. It encourages the kind of big, bold bets that can transform an organization." <BR>--John Chambers, executive chairman of Cisco<BR><BR>"In addition to being a terrific personal history of tech in Silicon Valley, Measure What Matters is an essential handbook for both small and large organizations; the methods described will definitely drive great execution."<BR>--Diane Greene, CEO of Google Cloud<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>John Doerr is an engineer, acclaimed venture capitalist, and the chairman of Kleiner Perkins. He was an original investor and board member at Google and Amazon, helping to create more than half a million jobs and the world's second and third most valuable companies. He's passionate about encouraging leaders to reimagine the future, from transforming healthcare to advancing applications of machine learning. Outside of Kleiner Perkins, John works with social entrepreneurs for change in public education, the climate crisis, and global poverty.

All rights reserved.<BR>1<BR><BR>Google, Meet OKRs<BR><BR>If you don't know where you're going, you might not get there.<BR><BR>--Yogi Berra<BR><BR>On a fall day in 1999, in the heart of Silicon Valley, I arrived at a two-story, L-shaped structure off the 101 freeway. It was young Google's headquarters, and I'd come with a gift.<BR><BR>The company had leased the building two months earlier, outgrowing a space above an ice-cream parlor in downtown Palo Alto. Two months before that, I'd placed my biggest bet in nineteen years as a venture capitalist, an $11.8 million wager for 12 percent of a start-up by a pair of Stanford grad school dropouts. I joined Google's board. I was committed, financially and emotionally, to do all I could to help it succeed.<BR><BR>Barely a year after incorporating, Google had planted its flag: to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." That might have sounded grandiose, but I had confidence in Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They were self-assured, even brash, but also curious and thoughtful. They listened--and they delivered.<BR><BR>Sergey was exuberant, mercurial, strongly opinionated, and able to leap intellectual chasms in a single bound. A Soviet-born immigrant, he was a canny, creative negotiator and a principled leader. Sergey was restless, always pushing for more; he might drop to the floor mid-meeting for a set of push-ups.<BR><BR>Larry was an engineer's engineer, the son of a computer science pioneer. He was a soft-spoken nonconformist, a rebel with a 10x cause: to make the internet exponentially more relevant. While Sergey crafted the commerce of technology, Larry toiled on the product and imagined the impossible. He was a blue-sky thinker with his feet on the ground.<BR><BR>Earlier that year, when the two of them came to my office to pitch me, their PowerPoint deck had just seventeen slides-and only two with numbers. (They added three cartoons just to flesh out the deck.) Though they'd made a small deal with the Washington Post, Google had yet to unlock the value of keyword-targeted ads. As the eighteenth search engine to arrive on the web, the company was way late to the party. Ceding the competition such a long head start was normally fatal, especially in technology.<BR><BR>But none of that stopped Larry from lecturing me on the poor quality of search in the market, and how much it could be improved, and how much bigger it would be tomorrow. He and Sergey had no doubt they would break through, never mind their lack of a business plan. Their PageRank algorithm was that much better than the competition, even in beta testing.<BR><BR>I asked them, "How big do you think this could be?" I'd already made my private calculation: If everything broke right, Google might reach a market cap of $1 billion. But I wanted to gauge their dreams.<BR><BR>And Larry responded, "Ten billion dollars."<BR><BR>Just to be sure, I said, "You mean market cap, right?"<BR><BR>And Larry shot back, "No, I don't mean market cap. I mean revenue."<BR><BR>I was floored. Assuming a normal growth rate for a profitable tech firm, $10 billion in revenue would imply a $100 billion market capitalization. That was the province of Microsoft and IBM and Intel. That was a creature rarer than a unicorn. There was no braggadocio to Larry, only calm, considered judgment. I didn't debate him; I was genuinely impressed. He and Sergey were determined to change the world, and I believed they had a shot.<BR><BR>Long before Gmail or Android or Chrome, Google brimmed with big ideas. The founders were quintessential visionaries, with extreme entrepreneurial energy. What they lacked was management experience. For Google to have real impact, or even to reach liftoff, they would have to learn to make tough choices and keep their team on track. Given their healthy appetite for risk, they'd need to pull the plug on losers-to fail fast.<BR><BR>Not least, they would need timely, relevant data. To track their progress. To measure what mattered.<BR><BR>And so: On that balmy day in Mountain View, I came with my present for Google, a sharp-edged tool for world-class execution. I'd first used it in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where Andy Grove, the greatest manager of his or any era, drove the best-run company I had ever seen. Since joining Kleiner Perkins, the Menlo Park VC firm, I had proselytized Grove's gospel far and wide, to fifty companies or more.<BR><BR>To be clear, I have the utmost reverence for entrepreneurs. I'm an inveterate techie who worships at the altar of innovation. But I'd also watched too many start-ups struggle with growth and scale and getting the right things done. So I'd come to a philosophy, a mantra:<BR><BR>Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.<BR><BR>In the early 1980s, I took a fourteen-month sabbatical from Kleiner to lead the desktop division at Sun Microsystems. Suddenly I found myself in charge of hundreds of people. I was terrified. Andy Grove's system was my bastion in a storm, a source of clarity in every meeting I led. It empowered my executive team and rallied the whole operation. Yes, we made our share of mistakes. But we also achieved amazing things, including a new RISC microprocessor architecture to secure Sun's lead in the workstation market. That was my personal proof point for what I was bringing, all these years later, to Google.<BR><BR>The practice that molded me at Intel and saved me at Sun-that still inspires me today-is called OKRs. Short for Objectives and Key Results, it's a collaborative goal-setting protocol for companies, teams, and individuals. Now, OKRs are not a silver bullet. They cannot substitute sound judgment, strong leadership, or a creative workplace culture. But if those fundamentals are in place, OKRs can guide you to the mountaintop.<BR><BR>Larry and Sergey--with Marissa Mayer, Susan Wojcicki, Salar Kamangar, and thirty or so others, pretty much the whole company at the time--gathered to hear me out. They stood around the ping-pong table (which doubled as their boardroom table), or sprawled in beanbag chairs, dormitory style. My first PowerPoint slide defined OKRs: "A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization."<BR><BR>An OBJECTIVE, I explained, is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational. When properly designed and deployed, they're a vaccine against fuzzy thinking-and fuzzy execution.<BR><BR>KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable. (As prize pupil Marissa Mayer would say, "It's not a key result unless it has a number.") You either meet a key result's requirements or you don't; there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the designated period, typically a quarter, we declare the key result fulfilled or not. Where an objective can be long-lived, rolled over for a year or longer, key results evolve as the work progresses. Once they are all completed, the objective is necessarily achieved. (And if it isn't, the OKR was poorly designed in the first place.)<BR><BR>My objective that day, I told the band of young Googlers, was to build a planning model for their company, as measured by three key results:<BR><BR>KR #1: I would finish my presentation on time.<BR><BR>KR #2: We'd create a sample set of quarterly Google OKRs.<BR><BR>KR #3: I'd gain management agreement for a three-month OKR trial.<BR><BR>By way of illustration, I sketched two OKR scenarios. The first involved a fictional football team whose general manager cascades a top-level objective down through the franchise org chart. The second was a real-life drama to which I'd had a ringside seat: Operation Crush, the campaign to restore Intel's dominance in the microprocessor market. (We'll delve into both in detail later on.)<BR><BR>I closed by recapping a value proposition that is no less compelling today. OKRs surface your primary goals. They channel efforts and coordination. They link diverse operations, lending purpose and unity to the entire organization.<BR><BR>I stopped talking at the ninety-minute mark, right on time. Now it was up to Google.<BR><BR>--<BR><BR>In 2009, the Harvard Business School published a paper titled "Goals Gone Wild." It led with a catalog of examples of "destructive goal pursuit": exploding Ford Pinto fuel tanks, wholesale gouging by Sears auto repair centers, Enron's recklessly inflated sales targets, the 1996 Mount Everest disaster that left eight climbers dead. Goals, the authors cautioned, were "a prescription-strength medication that requires careful dosing . . . and close supervision." They even posted a warning label: "Goals may cause systematic problems in organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased motivation." The dark side of goal setting could swamp any benefits, or so their argument went.<BR><BR>The paper struck a chord and is still widely cited. Its caveat is not without merit. Like any management system, OKRs may be executed well or badly; the aim of this book is to help you use them well. But make no mistake. For anyone striving for high performance in the workplace, goals are very necessary things.<BR><BR>In 1968, the year Intel opened shop, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland cast a theory that surely influenced Andy Grove. First, said Edwin Locke, "hard goals" drive performance more effectively than easy goals. Second, specific hard goals "produce a higher level of output" than vaguely worded admonitions to do your best.<BR><BR>In the intervening half century, more than a thousand studies have confirmed Locke's discovery as "one of the most tested, and proven, ideas in the whole of management theory." Among experiments in the field, 90 percent confirm that productivity is enhanced by well-defined, challenging goals.<BR><BR>Year after year, Gallup surveys attest to a "worldwide employee engagement crisis." Less than a third of U.S. workers are "involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace." Of those disengaged millions, more than half would leave their company for a raise of 20 percent or less. In the technology sector, two out of three employees think they could find a better job inside of two months.<BR><BR>In business, alienation isn't an abstract, philosophical problem; it saps the bottom line. More highly engaged work groups generate more profit and less turnover. According to Deloitte, the management and leadership consulting firm, issues of "retention and engagement have risen to No. 2 in the minds of business leaders, second only to the challenge of building global leadership."<BR><BR>But exactly how do you build engagement? A two-year Deloitte study found that no single factor has more impact than "clearly defined goals that are written down and shared freely. . . . Goals create alignment, clarity, and job satisfaction."<BR><BR>Goal setting isn't bulletproof: "When people have conflicting priorities or unclear, meaningless, or arbitrarily shifting goals, they become frustrated, cynical, and demotivated." An effective goal management system-an OKR system-links goals to a team's broader mission. It respects targets and deadlines while adapting to circumstances. It promotes feedback and celebrates wins, large and small. Most important, it expands our limits. It moves us to strive for what might seem beyond our reach.<BR><BR>As even the "Goals Gone Wild" crowd conceded, goals "can inspire employees and improve performance." That, in a nutshell, was my message for Larry and Sergey and company.<BR><BR>As I opened the floor for questions, my audience seemed intrigued. I guessed they might give OKRs a try, though I couldn't have foreseen the depth of their resolve. Sergey said, "Well, we need to have some organizing principle. We don't have one, and this might as well be it." But the marriage of Google and OKRs was anything but random. It was a great impedance match, a seamless gene transcription into Google's messenger RNA. OKRs were an elastic, data-driven apparatus for a freewheeling, data-worshipping enterprise. They promised transparency for a team that defaulted to open-open source, open systems, open web. They rewarded "good fails" and daring for two of the boldest thinkers of their time.<BR><BR>Google, meet OKRs: a perfect fit.<BR><BR>--<BR><BR>While Larry and Sergey had few preconceptions about running a business, they knew that writing goals down would make them real. They loved the notion of laying out what mattered most to them-on one or two succinct pages-and making it public to everyone at Google. They intuitively grasped how OKRs could keep an organization on course through the gales of competition or the tumult of a hockey-stick growth curve.<BR><BR>Along with Eric Schmidt, who two years later became Google's CEO, Larry and Sergey would be tenacious, insistent, even confrontational in their use of OKRs. As Schmidt told author Steven Levy, "Google's objective is to be the systematic innovator of scale. Innovator means new stuff. And scale means big, systematic ways of looking at things done in a way that's reproducible." Together, the triumvirate brought a decisive ingredient for OKR success: conviction and buy-in at the top.<BR><BR>--<BR><BR>As an investor, I am long on OKRs. As Google and Intel alumni continue to migrate and spread the good word, hundreds of companies of all types and sizes are committing to structured goal setting. OKRs are Swiss Army knives, suited to any environment. We've seen their broadest adoption in tech, where agility and teamwork are absolute imperatives. (In addition to the firms given the floor in this book, OKR adherents include AOL, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Oracle, Slack, Spotify, and Twitter.) But the system has also been adopted by household names far beyond Silicon Valley: Anheuser-Busch, BMW, Disney, Exxon, Samsung. In today's economy, change is a fact of life. We cannot cling to what's worked and hope for the best. We need a trusty scythe to carve a path ahead of the curve.<BR><BR>At smaller start-ups, where people absolutely need to be pulling in the same direction, OKRs are a survival tool. In the tech sector, in particular, young companies must grow quickly to get funding before their capital runs dry. Structured goals give backers a yardstick for success: We're going to build this product, and we've certified the market by talking to twenty-five customers, and here's how much they're willing to pay. At medium-size, rapidly scaling organizations, OKRs are a shared language for execution. They clarify expectations: What do we need to get done (and fast), and who's working on it? They keep employees aligned, vertically and horizontally.<BR><BR>In larger enterprises, OKRs are neon-lit road signs. They demolish silos and cultivate connections among far-flung contributors. By igniting frontline autonomy, they give rise to fresh solutions. And they keep even the most successful organizations stretching for more.<BR><BR>Similar benefits accrue in the not-for-profit world. At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a $20 billion start-up, OKRs deliver the real-time data Bill Gates needs to wage war against malaria, polio, and HIV. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a Gates alumna, ported the process to the federal Office of Management and Budget and later to the Department of Health and Human Services, where it helped the U.S. government fight Ebola.

"Remarkable.... Ekirch has emptied night's pockets, and laid the contents out before us." âArthur Krystal, The New Yorker<BR><BR>Bringing light to the shadows of history through a "rich weave of citation and archival evidence" (Publishers Weekly), scholar A. Roger Ekirch illuminates the aspects of life most often overlooked by other historiansâthose that unfold at night. In this "triumph of social history" (Mail on Sunday), Ekirch's "enthralling anthropology" (Harper's) exposes the nightlife that spawned a distinct culture and a refuge from daily life.<BR><BR>Fear of crime, of fire, and of the supernatural; the importance of moonlight; the increased incidence of sickness and death at night; evening gatherings to spin wool and stories; masqued balls; inns, taverns, and brothels; the strategies of thieves, assassins, and conspirators; the protective uses of incantations, meditations, and prayers; the nature of our predecessors' sleep and dreamsâEkirch reveals all these and more in his "monumental study" (The Nation) of sociocultural history, "maintaining throughout an infectious sense of wonder" (Booklist).<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"An enthralling anthropology of the shadow realms."<BR>â John Leonard, Harper's<BR><BR>"Absorbing...fascinating...[Ekirch] has plundered an extraordinary range of cross-cultural sources for his material, and he tells us about everything from witches to firefighting, architecture to domestic violence...[A] monumental study."<BR>â Terry Eagleton, The Nation<BR><BR>"This is an irresistibly fascinating book.

She wrote and self-published the first editions of The Encyclopedia of Country Living during the early 1970s and also ran her "School of Country Living." Carla sold nearly 90,000 copies of her self-published editions, traveling the country to promote it and appearing on such shows as The Mike Douglas Show, The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Phil Donahue Show, and Good Morning America, where she demonstrated country-living skills such as goat-milking, bread-making, and butter-churning.<BR><BR>When Sasquatch Books published the 9th Edition of Encyclopedia in 1994, Carla continued to travel the country promoting and selling the book, and teaching the timeless skills of country living. Carla cultivated a large and loyal following across the country. Carla passed away in 2005.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>What This Book Is<BR><BR>This book has been written--and rewritten--over a span of 32 years. Like a geological deposit, it has layers. The first layer was the ambitious 12-page table of contents I started compiling back in 1969. That's when I first got to thinking about this book. I wanted to put into one work everything someone would want or need to know about family food production. I wanted it to be a complete reference, an encyclopedia of information and skills, a practical resource anyone could use.<BR><BR>The "back to the land" movement had started happening then--a tremendous out-migration from cities to country. I was living in a tiny town in northern Idaho, and the newcomers were everywhere, full of urgent questions about growing plants and raising animals. So the next layer of the book got written as I tried to answer their questions, encourage them in the hard moments, and help them adapt to the harsh realities of country living. I was struggling to create for them an affordable, single-volume reference work on raising and preparing food--every kind of food, every step of the way--from planting a seed in the garden or mating animals to preparing a meal.<BR><BR>I was also trying to preserve the precious knowledge of an older generation of homesteaders--knowledge that was rapidly disappearing as that generation passed on. It seemed that traditional, "old-time" technologies were being cast aside as people flocked to petroleum-based technologies and centralized supply systems. I wanted to help record and preserve the traditional methods. They offer a workable alternative to petroleum-dependent technologies, and as we continue to deplete the earth's oil deposits, the old, self-sufficient methods will become more and more important to know<BR><BR>Mrs. Harless and Imogene Kepford were among the first old-timers I talked to. I visited their homes--where they always made me feel welcome--and listened to them, enjoying their blunt, charming, pioneer language. Their amazing knowledge about every aspect of home food production humbled me. I began trying out what they told me--and writing it down. Then I'd return to their homes to ask more questions, and I'd write those answers down too. When Mrs. Harless died unexpectedly about a year after I met her, I felt as though I'd lost a mother. And I realized how much harder and faster I needed to work on my project.<BR><BR>Today, a general ignorance about food production-- as well as the lack of land on which to grow plants or raise animals--makes most people captive consumers. Unlike their great-grandparents, the urbanized members of today's society are almost totally dependent on other people to produce their food, clothing, and shelter--and they're subject to the market prices for those essential commodities. Many people spend their lives a paycheck away from hunger or homelessness--because they must pay other people to supply their most basic needs.<BR><BR>I love education and books because they empower people. That's what this book is all about: providing you with the information you need to do things on your own, instead of paying someone else to do them for you.<BR><BR>Another layer of this book comes from the many people who have contributed to it. I've been helped by an army of persons who have shared recipes, advice, and information gained from years of experience. And every time I finished another edition of this book, people wrote to me with corrections, or with more information, or with important questions I hadn't answered. The book grew and improved edition after edition, prodded by those interactions with readers. So this isn't only "Carla's Book." Often I just had the humble task of stitching together information from other people, guided by the knowledge and experience I do have.<BR><BR>It took me four years to complete the first edition of this book. During that time, I was a lonely rural housewife, grateful for my pen pals from all over the country--wonderful people who read early parts of the book and shared with me recipes, advice, and encouragement. As I continued writing the book, I kept thinking about those faraway but precious friends, and I began including personal thoughts and memories in my book, sharing with my readers stories about myself, my past, my life. Thus, another layer emerged.<BR><BR>I added several more layers. I described mushroom cultivation and aquaculture, and updated the book to give advice on problems such as killer bees, global warming, and pesticide contamination in food. Because the international swapping of seeds has made a multitude of non-native, exotic plants available, I added extensive instructions for growing and cooking those plants. This information is useful to city folks as well, now that so many "new" fruits, vegetables, and herbs are appearing in supermarkets. I also added websites and e-mail addresses for over 1,500 mailorder sources. In fact, as this book has evolved, I've thought of more and more ways it could be useful to city- as well as country- dwelling people. I've begun to think of it as--and have strived to build it into--a basic kitchen reference work, so packed with reliable, practical information that any family, urban or rural, would want to own it. Is that the final layer? If the last 32 years are any indication, probably not!

How much does the Thomas Cromwell of popular novels and television series resemble the real Cromwell? This meticulous study of Cromwell's early political career expands and revises what has been understood concerning the life and talents of Henry VIII's chief minister. Michael Everett provides a new and enlightening account of Cromwell's rise to power, his influence on the king, his role in the Reformation, and his impact on the future of the nation.<BR><BR>Controversially, Everett depicts Cromwell not as the fervent evangelical, Machiavellian politician, or the revolutionary administrator that earlier historians have perceived. Instead he reveals Cromwell as a highly capable and efficient servant of the Crown, rising to power not by masterminding Henry VIII's split with Rome but rather by dint of exceptional skills as an administrator.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>"An original and scholarly work that succeeds in providing a more multi-dimensional view of Cromwell, his rise to power, and the politics of the early 1530s more generally, by extension also raising serious about how the rest of the decade played out."--Jonathan Harris, Journal of British Studies<BR>- Journal of British Studies - Jonathan Harris<BR><BR>Everett . . . offers a reinterpretation not only of Cromwell's significance, but also of the nature of politics at the Henrician court . . . A valuable contribution to the historiography of Cromwell's career."--Tracy Borman, American Historical Review<BR>- American Historical Review - Tracy Borman

Between 1930 and 1935, William Faulkner came into full possession of the genius and creativity that made him one of America's finest writers of the twentieth century. The four novels in this Library of America collection display an astonishing range of characters and treatments in his Depression-era fiction.<BR><BR>As I Lay Dying (1930) is a combination of comedy, horror, and compassion, a narrative woven from the inarticulate desires of a peasant family in conflict. It presents the conscious, unconscious, and sometimes hallucinatory impressions of the husband, daughter, and four sons of Addie Bundren, the long-suffering matriarch of her rural Mississippi clan, as the family marches her body through fire and flood to its grave in town.<BR><BR>Sanctuary (1931) is a novel of sex and social class, of collapsed gentility and amoral justice, that moves from the back roads of Mississippi and the fleshpots of Memphis to the courthouse of Jefferson and the appalling spectacle of popular vengeance. With its fascinating portraits of Popeye, a sadistic gangster and rapist, and Temple Drake, a debutante with an affinity for evil, it offers a horrific and sometimes comically macabre vision of modern life.<BR><BR>Light in August (1932) incorporates Faulkner's religious vision of the hopeful stubbornness of ordinary life. The guileless Lena Grove, in search of the father of her unborn child; the disgraced minister Gail Hightower, who dreams of Confederate cavalry charges; Byron Bunch, who thought working Saturdays would keep a man out of trouble, and the desperate, enigmatic Joe Christmas, consumed by his mixed ancestry--all find their lives entangled in the inexorable succession of love, birth, and death.<BR><BR>Pylon (1935), a tale of barnstorming aviators in the carnival atmosphere of an air show in a southern city, examines the bonds of desire and loyalty among three men and a woman, all characters without a past. Dramatizing what, in accepting his Nobel Prize, Faulkner called "the human heart in conflict with itself," it illustrates how he became one of the great humanists of twentieth-century literature.<BR><BR>The Library of America edition of Faulkner's work publishes, for the first time, new, corrected texts of these four works. Manuscripts, typescripts, galleys, and published editions have been collated to produce versions that are free of the changes introduced by the original editors and that are faithful to Faulkner's intentions.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>The Library of America begins publication of 20th-century writers with corrected texts of four novels from the midpoint of Faulkner's career. The corrections eliminate past editorial adjustments and present the works according to Faulkner's original intentions, based on extant typescripts and galley revisions. For example, editors often changed Faulkner's deliberately unusual punctuation to make his texts more appealing to general audiences; restored now are the "Faulknerian" dashes, missing apostrophes, compound words, and lengthy unpunctuated passages. Pylon received the most extensive revision, but all the changes are significant, and at last readers can enjoy and ponder these works in the form intended by their author. A distinguished addition to a distinguished series. Starr E. Smith, Georgetown Univ.

In his memoir American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson, host of The Late, Late Show, traces his journey from working-class Glasgow to the comedic limelight of Hollywood and American citizenship. Moving and achingly funny, American on Purpose moves from Ferguson's early life as an alcoholic to his stint on The Drew Carey Show to his decision to become a U.S. citizen in its unique and honest look at his version of the American dream. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A fine writer, witty, reflective, and candid.... Ferguson is a kinetic cutup teeming with foolishness, brilliance, defiance, and heart. All this is captured in his book as an entertaining connect-the-dots journey." (Associated Press)<BR><BR>"Hilariously vivid." (People)<BR><BR>"Funny and poignant and inspirational and brilliant. Nowhere in his story of emigration and redemption does Craig Ferguson realize that as lucky as he thinks he is to be 'American on Purpose,' we are luckier still to have him." (Keith Olbermann)<BR><BR>"With American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson somehow manages to avoid the pitfalls of self-indulgence and self-importance that plague most (okay, all) Hollywood autobiographies. He has, instead, written a book that is hilarious and irrepressibly daft, yet also kind, poignant, and undeniably wise. It was a joy to read." (Dennis Lehane, author of The Given Day)<BR><BR>"A great read . . . almost as good as my memoir." (Carrie Fisher, author of Wishful Drinking)<BR><BR>"Ferguson has given us a biographical treatment that is both brutally honest and inspirational...American on Purpose is a book that should be read." (Chicago Sun-Times)<BR><BR>"Hilarious and revealing...witty and emotional." (The Daily Beast)

Library of America's authoritative Fitzgerald edition continues with his greatest masterpiece and best story collection of stories in newly edited texts<BR><BR>This long-awaited second volume of Library of America's authoritative edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald features the author's acknowledged masterpiece and most popular book, The Great Gatsby.<BR><BR>It was Gatsby that solidified his reputation as the chronicler of the Jazz Age and established him as one of the leading American novelists of his generation. Perhaps no other novel of the twentieth century makes a greater claim to being our Great American Novel--for its poetic prose, its exploration of the broad, intertwined themes of money, class, and American optimism (Daisy Buchanan's voice is "full of money"), its dominance of high school and college curricula, and its claims upon the public imagination. The novel is presented in a newly edited text, correcting numerous errors and restoring Fitzgerald's preferred American spellings.<BR><BR>Also included in this volume are Fitzgerald's third collection of stories, All the Sad Young Men, which includes some of the author's best short fiction--"Winter Dreams," "The Rich Boy," and "Absolution"--as well as a generous selection of stories and nonfiction from the period 1920-1926, all in newly corrected texts.

All rights reserved.<BR>CHAPTER TWO<BR><BR>January 1914<BR><BR>Earl Fitzherbert, age twenty-eight, known to his family and friends as Fitz, was the ninth-richest man in Britain.<BR><BR>He had done nothing to earn his huge income. He had simply inherited thousands of acres of land in Wales and Yorkshire. The farms made little money, but there was coal beneath them, and by licensing mineral rights Fitz's grandfather had become enormously wealthy.<BR><BR>Clearly God intended the Fitzherberts to rule over their fellow men, and to live in appropriate style; but Fitz felt he had not done much to justify God's faith in him.<BR><BR>His father, the previous earl, had been different. A naval officer, he had been made admiral after the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882, had become the British ambassador to St. Petersburg, and finally had been a minister in the government of Lord Salisbury. The Conservatives lost the general election of 1906, and Fitz's father died a few weeks later--his end hastened, Fitz felt sure, by seeing irresponsible Liberals such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill take over His Majesty's government.<BR><BR>Fitz had taken his seat in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of the British Parliament, as a Conservative peer. He spoke good French and he could get by in Russian, and he would have liked one day to be his country's foreign secretary. Regrettably, the Liberals had continued to win elections, so he had had no chance yet of becoming a government minister.<BR><BR>His military career had been equally undistinguished. He had attended the army's officer training academy at Sandhurst, and had spent three years with the Welsh Rifles, ending as a captain. On marriage he had given up full-time soldiering, but had become honorary colonel of the South Wales Territorials. Unfortunately an honorary colonel never won medals.<BR><BR>However, he did have something to be proud of, he thought as the train steamed up through the South Wales valleys. In two weeks' time, the king was coming to stay at Fitz's country house. King George V and Fitz's father had been shipmates in their youth. Recently the king had expressed a wish to know what the younger men were thinking, and Fitz had organized a discreet house party for His Majesty to meet some of them. Now Fitz and his wife, Bea, were on their way to the house to get everything ready.<BR><BR>Fitz cherished traditions. Nothing known to mankind was superior to the comfortable order of monarchy, aristocracy, merchant, and peasant. But now, looking out of the train window, he saw a threat to the British way of life greater than any the country had faced for a hundred years. Covering the once-green hillsides, like a gray-black leaf blight on a rhododendron bush, were the terraced houses of the coal miners. In those grimy hovels there was talk of republicanism, atheism, and revolt. It was only a century or so since the French nobility had been driven in carts to the guillotine, and the same would happen here if some of those muscular black-faced miners had their way.

All rights reserved.<BR>Chapter 1<BR><BR>In a broad valley, at the foot of a sloping hillside, beside a clear bubbling stream, Tom was building a house. <BR><BR>The walls were already three feet high and rising fast. The two masons Tom had engaged were working steadily in the sunshine, their trowels going scrape, slap and then tap, tap while their laborer sweated under the weight of the big stone blocks. Tom's son Alfred was mixing mortar, counting aloud as he scooped sand onto a board. There was also a carpenter, working at the bench beside Tom, carefully shaping a length of beech wood with an adz. <BR><BR>Alfred was fourteen years old, and tall like Tom. Tom was a head higher than most men, and Alfred was only a couple of inches less, and still growing. They looked alike too: both had light-brown hair and greenish eyes with brown flecks. People said they were a handsome pair. The main difference between them was that Tom had a curly brown beard, whereas Alfred had only a fine blond fluff. The hair on Alfred's head had been that color once, Tom remembered fondly. Now that Alfred was becoming a man, Tom wished he would take a more intelligent interest in his work, for he had a lot to learn if he was to be a mason like his father; but so far Alfred remained bored and baffled by the principles of building. <BR><BR>When the house was finished it would be the most luxurious home for miles around. The ground floor would be a spacious undercroft, for storage, with a curved vault for a ceiling, so that it would not catch fire. The hall, where people actually lived, would be above, reached by an outside staircase, its height making it hard to attack and easy to defend. Against the hall wall there would be a chimney, to take away the smoke of the fire. This was a radical innovation: Tom had only ever seen one house with a chimney, but it had struck him as such a good idea that he was determined to copy it. At one end of the house, over the hall, there would be a small bedroom, for that was what earls' daughters demanded nowadays--they were too fine to sleep in the hall with the men and the serving wenches and the hunting dogs. The kitchen would be a separate building, for every kitchen caught fire sooner or later, and there was nothing for it but to build them far away from everything else and put up with lukewarm food. <BR><BR>Tom was making the doorway of the house. The doorposts would be rounded to look like columns--a touch of distinction for the noble newlyweds who were to live here. With his eye on the shaped wooden template he was using as a guide, Tom set his iron chisel obliquely against the stone and tapped it gently with the big wooden hammer. A small shower of fragments fell away from the surface, leaving the shape a little rounder. He did it again. Smooth enough for a cathedral. <BR><BR>He had worked on a cathedral once--Exeter. At first he had treated it like any other job. He had been angry and resentful when the master builder had warned him that his work was not quite up to standard: he knew himself to be rather more careful than the average mason. But then he realized that the walls of a cathedral had to be not just good, but perfect. This was because the cathedral was for God, and also because the building was so big that the slightest lean in the walls, the merest variation from the absolutely true and level, could weaken the structure fatally. Tom's resentment turned to fascination. The combination of a hugely ambitious building with merciless attention to the smallest detail opened Tom's eyes to the wonder of his craft. He learned from the Exeter master about the importance of proportion, the symbolism of various numbers, and the almost magical formulas for working out the correct width of a wall or the angle of a step in a spiral staircase. Such things captivated him. He was surprised to learn that many masons found them incomprehensible. <BR><BR>After a while Tom had become the master builder's right-hand man, and that was when he began to see the master's shortcomings. The man was a great craftsman and an incompetent organizer. He was completely baffled by the problems of obtaining the right quantity of stone to keep pace with the masons, making sure that the blacksmith made enough of the right tools, burning lime and carting sand for the mortar makers, felling trees for the carpenters, and getting enough money from the cathedral chapter to pay for everything. <BR><BR>If Tom had stayed at Exeter until the master builder died, he might have become master himself; but the chapter ran out of money--partly because of the master's mismanagement--and the craftsmen had to move on, looking for work elsewhere. Tom had been offered the post of builder to the Exeter castellan, repairing and improving the city's fortifications. It would have been a lifetime job, barring accidents. But Tom had turned it down, for he wanted to build another cathedral. <BR><BR>His wife, Agnes, had never understood that decision. They might have had a good stone house, and servants, and their own stables, and meat on the table every dinnertime; and she had never forgiven Tom for turning down the opportunity. She could not comprehend the irresistible attraction of building a cathedral: the absorbing complexity of organization, the intellectual challenge of the calculations, the sheer size of the walls, and the breathtaking beauty and grandeur of the finished building. Once he had tasted that wine, Tom was never satisfied with anything less. <BR><BR>That had been ten years ago. Since then they had never stayed anywhere for very long. He would design a new chapter house for a monastery, work for a year or two on a castle, or build a town house for a rich merchant; but as soon as he had some money saved he would leave, with his wife and children, and take to the road, looking for another cathedral. <BR><BR>He glanced up from his bench and saw Agnes standing at the edge of the building site, holding a basket of food in one hand and resting a big jug of beer on the opposite hip. It was midday. He looked at her fondly. No one would ever call her pretty, but her face was full of strength: a broad forehead, large brown eyes, a straight nose, a strong jaw. Her dark, wiry hair was parted in the middle and tied behind. She was Tom's soul mate. <BR><BR>She poured beer for Tom and Alfred. They stood there for a moment, the two big men and the strong woman, drinking beer from wooden cups; and then the fourth member of the family came skipping out of the wheat field: Martha, seven years old and as pretty as a daffodil, but a daffodil with a petal missing, for she had a gap where two milk teeth had fallen out and the new ones had not yet grown. She ran to Tom, kissed his dusty beard, and begged a sip of his bear. He hugged her bony body. "Don't drink too much, or you'll fall into a ditch," he said. She staggered around in a circle, pretending to be drunk. <BR><BR>They all sat down on the woodpile. Agnes handed Tom a hunk of wheat bread, a thick slice of boiled bacon and a small onion. He took a bite from the meat and started to peel the onion. Agnes gave the children food and began to eat her own. Perhaps it was irresponsible, Tom thought, to turn down that dull job in Exeter and go looking for a cathedral to build; but I've always been able to feed them all, despite my recklessness. <BR><BR>He took his eating knife from the front pocket of his leather apron, cut a slice off the onion, and ate it with a bite of bread. The onion was sweet and stinging in his mouth. Agnes said: "I'm with child again." <BR><BR>Tom stopped chewing and stared at her. A thrill of delight took hold of him. Not knowing what to say, he just smiled foolishly at her. After a few moments she blushed, and said, "It isn't that surprising." <BR><BR>Tom hugged her. "Well, well," he said, still grinning with pleasure. "A babe to pull my beard. And I thought the next would be Alfred's." <BR><BR>"Don't get too happy yet," Agnes cautioned. "It's bad luck to name the child before it's born." <BR><BR>Tom nodded assent. Agnes had had several miscarriages and one stillborn baby, and there had been another little girl, Matilda, who had lived on two years. "I'd like a boy, though," he said. "Now that Alfred's so big. When is it due?" <BR><BR>"After Christmas." <BR><BR>Tom began to calculate. The shell of the house would be finished by first frost, then the stonework would have to be covered with straw to protect it through the winter. The masons would spend the cold months cutting stones for windows, vaults, doorcases and the fireplace, while the carpenter made floorboards and doors and shutters and Tom built the scaffolding for the upstairs work. Then in spring they would vault the undercroft, floor the hall above it, and put on the roof. The job would feed the family until Whitsun, by which time the baby would be a half year old. Then they would move on. "Good," he said contentedly. "This is good." He ate another slice of onion. <BR><BR>"I'm too old to bare children," said Agnes. "This must be my last." <BR><BR>Tom thought about that. He was not sure how old she was, in numbers, but plenty of women bore children at her time in life. However, it was true they suffered more as they grew older, and the babies were not as strong. No doubt she was right. But how would she make certain that she would not conceive again? he wondered. Then he realized how, and a cloud shadowed his sunny mood. <BR><BR>"I may get a good job, in a town," he said, trying to mollify her. "A cathedral, or a palace. Then we might have a big house with wood floors, and a maid to help you with the baby." <BR><BR>Her face hardened, and she said skeptically: "It may be." She did not like to hear talk of cathedrals. If Tom had never worked on a cathedral, her face said, she might be living in a town house now, with money saved up and buried under the fireplace, and nothing to worry about. <BR><BR>Tom looked away and took another bite of bacon. They had something to celebrate, but they were in disharmony. He felt let down. He chewed the tough meat for a while, then he heard a horse. He cocked his head to listen. The rider was coming through the trees from the direction of the road, taking a short cut and avoiding the village. <BR><BR>A moment later, a young man on a pony trotted up and dismounted. He looked like a squire, a kind of apprentice knight. "Your lord is coming," he said. <BR><BR>Tom stood up. "You mean Lord Percy?" Percy Hamleigh was one of the most important men in the country. He owned this valley, and many others, and he was paying for the house. <BR><BR>"His son," said the squire. <BR><BR>"Young William." Percy's son, William, was to occupy this house after his marriage. He was engaged to Lady Aliena, the daughter of the earl of Shiring. <BR><BR>"The same," said the squire, "And in a rage." <BR><BR>Tom's heart sank. At the best of times it could be difficult to deal with the owner of a house under construction. An owner in a rage was impossible. "What's he angry about?" <BR><BR>"His bride rejected him." <BR><BR>"The earl's daughter?" said Tom in surprise. He felt a pang of fear: he had just been thinking how secure his future was. "I thought that was settled." <BR><BR>"So did we all--except Lady Aliena, it seems," the squire said. "The moment she met him, she announced that she wouldn't marry him for all the world and a woodcock." <BR><BR>Tom frowned worriedly. He did not want this to be true. "But the boy's not bad-looking, as I recall." <BR><BR>Agnes said: "As if that made any difference, in her position. If earls' daughters were allowed to marry whom they please, we'd all be ruled by strolling minstrels and dark-eyed outlaws." <BR><BR>"The girl may yet change her mind," Tom said hopefully. <BR><BR>"She will if her mother takes a birch rod to her," Agnes said. <BR><BR>The squire said: "Her mother's dead." <BR><BR>Agnes nodded. "That explains why she doesn't know the facts of life. But I don't see why her father can't compel her." <BR><BR>The squire said: "It seems he once promised he would never marry her to someone she hated." <BR><BR>"A foolish pledge!" Tom said angrily. How could a powerful man tie himself to the whim of a girl in that way? Her marriage could affect military alliances, baronial finances... even the building of this house. <BR><BR>The squire said: "She had a brother, so it's not so important whom she marries." <BR><BR>"Even so..."<BR><BR>"And the earl is an unbending man," the squire went on. "He won't go back on a promise, even one made to a child." He shrugged. "So they say." <BR><BR>Tom looked at the low stone walls of the house-to-be. He had not yet saved enough money to keep the family through winter, he realized with a chill. "Perhaps the lad will find another bride to share this place with him. He's got the whole county to choose from." <BR><BR>Alfred spoke in a cracked adolescent voice. "By Christ, I think this is him." Following his gaze, they all looked across the field. A horse was coming from the village in a gallop, kicking up a cloud of dust and earth from the pathway. Alfred's oath was prompted by the size as well as the speed of the horse: it was huge. Tom had seen beasts like it before, but perhaps Alfred had not. It was a war-horse, as high at the wither as a man's chin, and broad in proportion. Such war-horses were not bred in England, but came from overseas, and were enormously costly. <BR><BR>Tom dropped the remains of his bread in the pocket of his apron, then narrowed his eyes against the sun and gazed across the field. The horse had its ears back and nostrils flared, but it seemed to Tom that its head was up, a sign that it was not completely out of control. Sure enough, as it came closer the rider leaned back, hauling on the reins, and the huge animal seemed to slow a little. Now Tom could feel the drumming of its hooves in the ground beneath his feet. He looked around for Martha, thinking to pick her up and put her out of harm's way. Agnes had the same thought. But Martha was not to be seen. <BR><BR>"In the wheat," Agnes said, but Tom had already figured that out and was striding across the site to the edge of the field. He scanned the waving wheat with fear in his heart but he could not see the child. <BR><BR>The only thing he could think of was to try and slow the horse. He stepped into the path and began to walk toward the charging beast, holding his arms wide. The horse saw him, raised its head for a better look, and slowed perceptibly. Then, to Tom's horror, the rider spurred it on. <BR><BR>"You damned fool!" Tom roared, although the rider could not hear. <BR><BR>That was when Martha stepped out of the field and into the pathway a few yards in front of Tom. <BR><BR>For an instant Tom stood still in a sick panic. Then he leaped forward, shouting and waving his arms; but this was a war-horse, trained to charge at yelling hordes, and it did not flinch. Martha stood in the middle of the narrow path, staring as if transfixed by the huge beast bearing down on her. There was a moment when Tom realized desperately that he could not get to her before the horse did. He swerved to one side, his arm touching the standing wheat; and at the last instant the horse swerved to the other side. The rise's stirrup brushed Martha's fine hair; a hoof stamped a hole in the ground beside her bare foot; then the horse had gone by, spraying them both with dirt, and Tom snatched her up in his arms and held her tight to his pounding heart. <BR><BR>He stood still for a moment, awash with relief, his limbs weak, his insides watery. Then he felt a surge of fury at the recklessness of the stupid youth on his massive war-horse. He looked up angrily. Lord William was slowing the horse now, sitting back in the saddle, with his feet pushed forward into the stirrups, sawing on the reins. The horse swerved to avoid the building site. It tossed its head and then bucked, but William stayed on. He slowed it to a canter and then a trot as he guided it around in a wide circle. <BR><BR>Martha was crying. Tom handed her to Agnes and waited for William. The young lord was a tall, well-built fellow of about twenty years, with yellow hair and narrow eyes which made him look as if he were always peering into the sun. He wore a short black tunic with black hose, and leather shoes with straps crisscrossed up to his knees. He saw well on the horse and did not seem shaken by what had happened. The foolish boy doesn't even know what he's done, Tom thought bitterly. I'd like to wring his neck. <BR><BR>William halted the horse in front of the woodpile and looked down at the builders. "Who's in charge here?" he said. <BR><BR>Tom wanted to say If you had hurt my little girl, I would have killed you, but he suppressed his rage. It was like swallowing a bitter mouthful. He approached the horse and held its bridle. "I'm the master builder," he said tightly. "My name is Tom." <BR><BR>"This house is no longer needed," said William. "Dismiss your men." <BR><BR>It was what Tom had been dreading. But he held on to the hope that William was being impetuous in his anger, and might be persuaded to change his mind. With an effort, he made his voice friendly and reasonable. "But so much work has been done," he said. "Why waste what you've spent? You'll need the house one day." <BR><BR>"Don't tell me how to manage my affairs, Tom Builder," said William. "You're all dismissed." He twitched a rein, but Tom had hold of the bridle. "Let go of my horse," said William dangerously. <BR><BR>Tom swallowed. In a moment William would try to get the horse's head up. Tom felt in his apron pocket and brought out the crust of bread he had been eating. He showed it to the horse, which dipped its head and took a bite. "There's more to be said, before you leave, my lord," he said mildly. <BR><BR>William said, "Let my horse go, or I'll take your head off." Tom looked directly at him, trying not to show fear. He was bigger than William, but that would make no difference if the young lord drew his sword. <BR><BR>Agnes muttered fearfully, "Do as the lord says, husband." <BR><BR>There was dead silence. The other workmen stood as still as statues, watching. Tom knew that the prudent thing would be to give in. But William had nearly trampled Tom's little girl, and that made Tom mad, so with a racing heart he said: "You have to pay us." <BR><BR>William pulled on the reins but Tom held the bridle tight, and the horse as distracted, nuzzling in Tom's apron pocket for more food. "Apply to my father for your wages!" William said angrily. <BR><BR>Tom heard the carpenter say in a terrified voice: "We'll do that, my lord, thanking you very much." <BR><BR>Wretched coward, Tom thought, but he was trembling himself. Nevertheless he forced himself to say: "If you want to dismiss us, you must pay us, according to the custom. Your father's house is two days' walk from here, and when we arrive he may not be there." <BR><BR>"Men have died for less than this," William said. His cheeks reddened with anger. <BR><BR>Out of the corner of his eye, Tom saw the squire drop his hand to the hilt of his sword. He knew he should give up now, and humble himself, but there was an obstinate knot of anger in his belly, and as scared as he was he could not bring himself to release the bridle. "Pay us first, then kill me," he said recklessly. "You may hang for it, or you may not; but you'll die sooner or later, and then I will be in heaven and you will be in hell." <BR><BR>The sneer froze on William's face and he paled. Tom was surprised: what had frightened the boy? Not the mention of hanging, surely: it was not really likely that a lord would be hanged for the murder of a craftsman. Was he terrified of hell? <BR><BR>They stared at one another for a few moments. Tom watched with amazement and relief as William's set expression of anger and contempt melted away, to be replaced with panicked anxiety. At last William took a leather purse from his belt and tossed it to his squire, saying: "Pay them." <BR><BR>At that point Tom pushed his luck. When William pulled on the reins again, and the horse lifted its strong head and stepped sideways, Tom moved with the horse and held on to the bridle, and said: "A full week's wages on dismissal, as is the custom." He heard a sharp intake of breath from Agnes, just behind him, and he knew she thought he was crazy to prolong the confrontation. But he plowed on. "That's sixpence for the laborer, twelve for the carpenter and each of the masons, and twenty-four pence for me. Sixty-six pence in all." He could add pennies faster than anyone he knew. <BR><BR>The squire was looking inquiring at his master. William said angrily: "Very well."<BR><BR>Tom released the bridle and stepped back. <BR><BR>William turned the horse and kicked it hard, and it bounded forward onto the path through the wheat field. <BR><BR>Tom sat down suddenly on the woodpile. He wondered what had got into him. It had been mad to defy Lord William like that. He felt lucky to be alive. <BR><BR>The hoof beats of William's war-horse faded to a distant thunder, and his squire emptied the purse onto a board. Tom felt a surge of triumph as the silver pennies tumbled out into the sun-shine. It had been mad, but it had worked: he had secured just payment for himself and the men working under him. "Even lords ought to follow customs," he said, half to himself. <BR><BR>Agnes heard him. "Just hope you're never in want of work from Lord William," she said sourly. <BR><BR>Tom smiled at her. He understood that she was churlish because she was frightened. "Don't frown too much, or you'll have nothing but curdled milk in your breasts when that baby is born." <BR><BR>"I won't be able to feed any of us unless you find work for the winter." <BR><BR>"The winter's a long way off," said Tom. <BR><BR></div

#1 New York Times Bestseller<BR><BR>In 1989, Ken Follett astonished the literary world with The Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping epic novel set in twelfth-century England centered on the building of a cathedral and many of the hundreds of lives it affected. Critics were overwhelmed--"it will hold you, fascinate you, surround you" (Chicago Tribune)--and readers everywhere hoped for a sequel. <BR><BR>World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time the men and women of an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroads of new ideas--about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race--the Black Death. <BR><BR>Three years in the writing and nearly eighteen years since its predecessor, World Without End breathes new life into the epic historical novel and once again shows that Ken Follett is a masterful author writing at the top of his craft.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Praise for World Without End:<BR><BR>"[A] well-researched, beautifully detailed portrait of the late Middle Ages . . . Follett's no-frills prose does its job, getting smoothly through more than a thousand pages of outlaws, war, death, sex, and politics to end with an edifice that is as well constructed and solid as Merthin's bridge." --The Washington Post<BR><BR>"Follett tells a story that runs the gamut of life in the Middle Ages, and he does so in such a way that we are not only captivated but also educated. What else could you ask for?" --The Denver Post<BR><BR>"So if historical fiction is your meat, here's a rare treat. A feast of conflicts and struggles among religious authority, royal governance, the powerful unions (or guilds) of the day, and the peasantry . . . With World Without End, Follett proves his Pillars may be a rarity, but it wasn't a fluke." --New York Post<BR><BR>"A work that stands as something of a triumph of industry and professionalism."--The Guardian (UK)<BR><BR>"The four well-drawn central characters will captivate readers as they prove to be heroic, depraved, resourceful, or mean. Fans of Follett's previous medieval epic will be well rewarded." --The Union (CA)<BR><BR>"Populated with an immense cast of truly remarkable characters . . . this is not a book to be devoured in one sitting, tempting though that might be, but one to savor for its drama, depth, and richness." --Library Journal<BR><BR>"Readers will be captivated." --Publishers Weekly<BR>- From the Publisher

The long-awaited sequel to A Column of Fire, The Armor of Light, heralds a new dawn for Kingsbridge, England, where progress clashes with tradition, class struggles push into every part of society, and war in Europe engulfs the entire continent and beyond.<BR><BR>The Spinning Jenny was invented in 1770, and with that, a new era of manufacturing and industry changed lives everywhere within a generation. A world filled with unrest wrestles for control over this new world order: A mother's husband is killed in a work accident due to negligence; a young woman fights to fund her school for impoverished children; a well-intentioned young man unexpectedly inherits a failing business; one man ruthlessly protects his wealth no matter the cost, all the while war cries are heard from France, as Napoleon sets forth a violent master plan to become emperor of the world. As institutions are challenged and toppled in unprecedented fashion, ripples of change ricochet through our characters' lives as they are left to reckon with the future and a world they must rebuild from the ashes of war.<BR><BR>Over thirty years ago, Ken Follett published his most popular novel, The Pillars of the Earth. Now, with this electrifying addition to the Kingsbridge series we are plunged into the battlefield between compassion and greed, love and hate, progress and tradition. It is through each character that we are given a new perspective to the seismic shifts that shook the world in nineteenth-century Europe.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>Praise for The Armor of Light<BR><BR>"A treat for fans of historical fiction."<BR>--Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<BR><BR>"This epic canvas holds a mélange of relationships which all work out exactly as they should while Follett brings Kingsbridge up to the Regency era."<BR>--Booklist<BR><BR>"An impressive and immersive epic."<BR>--Publisher's Weekly<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Ken Follett is one of the world's best-loved authors, selling more than 188 million copies of his thirty-six books. Follett's first bestseller was Eye of the Needle, a spy story set in the Second World War. In 1989, The Pillars of the Earth was published and has since become Follett's most popular novel. It reached number one on bestseller lists around the world and was an Oprah's Book Club pick. Its sequels, World Without End and A Column of Fire, and prequel The Evening and the Morning, proved equally popular, and the Kingsbridge series has sold more than fifty million copies worldwide. Follett lives in Hertfordshire, England, with his wife, Barbara. Between them they have five children, six grandchildren, and three Labradors.

"Writing has been of Great Use to me in the Course of my Life," Benjamin Franklin said in his famous Autobiography. With characteristically calculated understatement, he attributed his enormous and varied successes to "my having learnt a little to scribble."<BR><BR>This Library of America collection of Franklin's works begins with letters sent from London (1757-1775) describing the events and diplomacy preceding the Revolutionary War. The volume also contains political satires, bagatelles, pamphlets, and letters written in Paris (1776-1785), where he represented the revolutionary United States at the court of Louis XVI, as well as his speeches given in the Constitutional Convention and other works written in Philadelphia (1785-1790), including his last published article, a searing satire against slavery.<BR><BR>Also included are the delightfully shrewd prefaces to Poor Richard's Almanack (1733-1758) and their worldly, pungent maxims that have entered our American culture. Finally, the classic Autobiography, Franklin's last word on his greatest literary creation--his own invented personality--is presented here in a new edition, completely faithful to Franklin's manuscript.<BR><BR>A companion volume includes the complete "Silence Dogood" series, "Busy-Body" essays, and a generous selection of his early writings, including letters to the press, satires, and pamphlets.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Benjamin Franklin, statesman, philosopher, and man of letters, was born in Boston in 1706 of Protestant parents. He entered Boston Grammar School when he was eight and later attended George Brown Ell's school. When he was twelve his father apprenticed him to his half-brother James as a printer. James was later the publisher of the New England Courant, where Franklin's first articles, The Dogood Papers, were published before he was seventeen. He went to Philadelphia in 1723 and pursued his trade of printer. He was befriended by William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania, who offered to help the young man get started in business. Franklin left for England, where he hoped to arrange for the purchase of printing equipment. Arriving in London in 1724, he was soon deserted by Keith, and again turned to printing for a livelihood. His privately printed Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain (1725) introduced him to leading Deists and other intellectuals in London. A year later, he returned to Philadelphia, and by 1730 he had been appointed public printer for Pennsylvania. In 1731 he established the first circulation library in the United States; in 1743-44, The American Philosophical Society. In 1748 he retired from the trade of printer but continued to advise and back his partner and to draw profit from the business. Poor Richard's Almanack was his most spectacular success as a publisher, having gone through numerous editions and been translated in many languages. During the next thirty-five years he devoted himself largely to politics and diplomacy, but still wrote and engaged in scientific ventures. He resigned as Minister to France in 1785, returned to America, and was elected President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Still concerned with the rights of the individual, he published papers encouraging the abolition of slavery. He died in Philadelphia in 1790.

Far more than a history of the Silk Roads, this book is truly a revelatory new history of the world, promising to destabilize notions of where we come from and where we are headed next. From the Middle East and its political instability to China and its economic rise, the vast region stretching eastward from the Balkans across the steppe and South Asia has been thrust into the global spotlight in recent years. Frankopan teaches us that to understand what is at stake for the cities and nations built on these intricate trade routes, we must first understand their astounding pasts. <BR><BR>Frankopan realigns our understanding of the world, pointing us eastward. It was on the Silk Roads that East and West first encountered each other through trade and conquest, leading to the spread of ideas, cultures and religions. From the rise and fall of empires to the spread of Buddhism and the advent of Christianity and Islam, right up to the great wars of the twentieth century--this book shows how the fate of the West has always been inextricably linked to the East.<BR><BR>Also available: The New Silk Roads, a timely exploration of the dramatic and profound changes our world is undergoing right now--as seen from the perspective of the rising powers of the East.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"One of Mr. Frankopan's gifts as a storyteller is his ability to draw unusual connections across his vast canvas . . . . Frankopan has written a rare book that makes you question your assumptions about the world." --The Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"This provocative history challenges the view of the West as heir to a pure Greco-Roman culture. . . . Frankopan marshals diverse examples to demonstrate the interconnectedness of cultures, showing in vivid detail the economic and social impact of the silk and the slave trades, the Black Death, and the Buddhist influence on Christianity." --The New Yorker<BR><BR>"In his new book, The Silk Roads, Frankopan has created something that forces us to sit up and reconsider the world and the way we've always thought about it. . . . The book takes us by surprise right from the start." --NPR<BR><BR>"This is deeply researched popular history at its most invigorating, primed to dislodge routine preconceptions and to pour in other light. The freshness of . . . Frankopan's sources is stimulating, and their sheer range can provoke surprising connections. He likes to administer passing electric shocks." --Colin Thubron, New York Review of Books<BR><BR>"This is history on a grand scale, with a sweep and ambition that is rare. . . . A remarkable book on many levels, a proper historical epic of dazzling range and achievement." --William Dalrymple, The Guardian<BR><BR>"A glorious read. . . . Frankopan is an exhilarating companion for the journey along the routes which conveyed silk, slaves, ideas, religion, and disease, and around which today may hang the destiny of the world." --Vanity Fair<BR><BR>"Dazzlingly rich and accessible. . . . By reorienting the history of the last few millennia to the east, and by resolutely keeping the camera rolling there, Frankopan unhooks us from the usual story of 'Western Civ' and gives us a startling and brilliant perspective on events that may once have been familiar--and plenty that aren't." --The Philadelphia Inquirer<BR><BR>"Beautifully constructed, a terrific and exhilarating read and a new perspective on world history." --History Today<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>PETER FRANKOPAN is a historian based at Oxford University. He is the author of The First Crusade: The Call from the East, a major monograph about Byzantium, Islam and the West in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

All rights reserved.<BR>Preface<BR><BR>As a child, one of my most prized possessions was a large map of the world. It was pinned on the wall by my bed, and I would stare at it every night before I went to sleep. Before long, I had memorised the names and locations of all the countries, noting their capital cities, as well as the oceans and seas, and the rivers that flowed in to them; the names of major mountain ranges and deserts, written in urgent italics, thrilled with adventure and danger.<BR><BR>By the time I was a teenager, I had become uneasy about the relentlessly narrow geographic focus of my classes at school, which concentrated solely on western Europe and the United States and left most of the rest of the world untouched. We had been taught about the Romans in Britain; the Norman conquest of 1066; Henry VIII and the Tudors; the American War of Independence; Victorian industrialisation; the battle of the Somme; and the rise and fall of Nazi Germany. I would look up at my map and see huge regions of the world that had been passed over in silence.<BR><BR>For my fourteenth birthday my parents gave me a book by the anthropologist Eric Wolf, which really lit the tinder. The accepted and lazy history of civilisation, wrote Wolf, is one where "Ancient Greece begat Rome, Rome begat Christian Europe, Christian Europe begat the Renaissance, the Renaissance the Enlightenment, the Enlightenment political democracy and the industrial revolution. Industry crossed with democracy in turn yielded the United States, embodying the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." I immediately recognised that this was exactly the story that I had been told: the mantra of the political, cultural and moral triumph of the west. But this account was flawed; there were alternative ways of looking at history--ones that did not involve looking at the past from the perspective of the winners of recent history.<BR><BR>I was hooked. It was suddenly obvious that the regions we were not being taught about had become lost, suffocated by the insistent story of the rise of Europe. I begged my father to take me to see the Hereford Mappa Mundi, which located Jerusalem as its focus and mid-point, with England and other western countries placed off to one side, all but irrelevancies. When I read about Arab geographers whose works were accompanied by charts that seemed upside down and put the Caspian Sea at its centre, I was transfixed--as I was when I found out about an important medieval Turkish map in Istanbul that had at its heart a city called Bal&#257;s&#257;gh&#363;n, which I had never even heard of, which did not appear on any maps, and whose very location was uncertain until recently, and yet was once considered the centre of the world.<BR><BR>I wanted to know more about Russia and Central Asia, about Persia and Mesopotamia. I wanted to understand the origins of Christianity when viewed from Asia; and how the Crusades looked to those living in the great cities of the Middle Ages--Constantinople, Jerusalem, Baghdad and Cairo, for example; I wanted to learn about the great empires of the east, about the Mongols and their conquests; and to understand how two world wars looked when viewed not from Flanders or the eastern front, but from Afghanistan and India.<BR><BR>It was extraordinarily fortunate therefore that I was able to learn Russian at school, where I was taught by Dick Haddon, a brilliant man who had served in Naval Intelligence and believed that the way to understand the Russian language and dusha, or soul, was through its sparkling literature and its peasant music. I was even more fortunate when he offered to give Arabic lessons to those who were interested, introducing half a dozen of us to Islamic culture and history, and immersing us in the beauty of classical Arabic. These languages helped unlock a world waiting to be discovered, or, as I soon realised, to be rediscovered by those of us in the west.<BR><BR>Today, much attention is devoted to assessing the likely impact of rapid economic growth in China, where demand for luxury goods is forecast to quadruple in the next decade, or to considering social change in India, where more people have access to a mobile phone than to a flushing toilet. But neither offers the best vantage point to view the world's past and its present. In fact, for millennia, it was the region lying between east and west, linking Europe with the Pacific Ocean, that was the axis on which the globe spun.<BR><BR>The halfway point between east and west, running broadly from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to the Himalayas, might seem an unpromising position from which to assess the world. This is a region that is now home to states that evoke the exotic and the peripheral, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and the countries of the Caucasus; it is a region associated with regimes that are unstable, violent and a threat to international security, like Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Syria, or ill versed in the best practices of democracy, like Russia and Azerbaijan. Overall, it appears to be a region that is home to a series of failed or failing states, led by dictators who win impossibly large majorities in national elections and whose families and friends control sprawling business interests, own vast assets and wield political power. They are places with poor records on human rights, where freedom of expression in matters of faith, conscience and sexuality is limited, and where control of the media dictates what does and what does not appear in the press.<BR><BR>While such countries may seem wild to us, these are no backwaters, no obscure wastelands. In fact the bridge between east and west is the very crossroads of civilisation. Far from being on the fringe of global affairs, these countries lie at its very centre--as they have done since the beginning of history. It was here that Civilisation was born, and where many believed Mankind had been created--in the Garden of Eden, "planted by the Lord God" with "every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food," which was widely thought to be located in the rich fields between the Tigris and Euphrates.<BR><BR>It was in this bridge between east and west that great metropolises were established nearly 5,000 years ago, where the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus valley were wonders of the ancient world, with populations numbering in the tens of thousands and streets connecting into a sophisticated sewage system that would not be rivalled in Europe for thousands of years. Other great centres of civilisation such as Babylon, Nineveh, Uruk and Akkad in Mesopotamia were famed for their grandeur and architectural innovation. One Chinese geographer, meanwhile, writing more than two millennia ago, noted that the inhabitants of Bactria, centred on the Oxus river and now located in northern Afghanistan, were legendary negotiators and traders; its capital city was home to a market where a huge range of products were bought and sold, carried from far and wide.<BR><BR>This region is where the world's great religions burst into life, where Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism jostled with each other. It is the cauldron where language groups competed, where Indo-European, Semitic and Sino-Tibetan tongues wagged alongside those speaking Altaic, Turkic and Caucasian. This is where great empires rose and fell, where the after-effects of clashes between cultures and rivals were felt thousands of miles away. Standing here opened up new ways to view the past and showed a world that was profoundly interconnected, where what happened on one continent had an impact on another, where the after-shocks of what happened on the steppes of Central Asia could be felt in North Africa, where events in Baghdad resonated in Scandinavia, where discoveries in the Americas altered the prices of goods in China and led to a surge in demand in the horse markets of northern India.<BR><BR>These tremors were carried along a network that fans out in every direction, routes along which pilgrims and warriors, nomads and merchants have travelled, goods and produce have been bought and sold, and ideas exchanged, adapted and refined. They have carried not only prosperity, but also death and violence, disease and disaster. In the late nineteenth century, this sprawling web of connections was given a name by an eminent German geologist, Ferdinand von Richthofen (uncle of the First World War flying ace the "Red Baron") that has stuck ever since: "Seidenstraßen"--the Silk Roads.<BR><BR>These pathways serve as the world's central nervous system, connecting peoples and places together, but lying beneath the skin, invisible to the naked eye. Just as anatomy explains how the body functions, understanding these connections allows us to understand how the world works. And yet, despite the importance of this part of the world, it has been forgotten by mainstream history. In part, this is because of what has been called "orientalism"--the strident and overwhelmingly negative view of the east as undeveloped and inferior to the west, and therefore unworthy of serious study. But it also stems from the fact that the narrative of the past has become so dominant and well established that there is no place for a region that has long been seen as peripheral to the story of the rise of Europe and of western society.<BR><BR>Today, Jalalabad and Herat in Afghanistan, Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq or Homs and Aleppo in Syria seem synonymous with religious fundamentalism and sectarian violence. The present has washed away the past: gone are the days when the name of Kabul conjured up images of the gardens planted and tended by the great B&#257;bur, founder of the Mughal Empire in India. The Bagh-i-Wafa ("Garden of Fidelity") included a pool surrounded by orange and pomegranate trees and a clover meadow--of which B&#257;bur was extremely proud: "This is the best part of the garden, a most beautiful sight when the oranges take colour. Truly that garden is admirably situated!"<BR><BR>In the same way, modern impressions about Iran have obscured the glories of its more distant history when its Persian predecessor was a byword for good taste in everything, from the fruit served at dinner, to the stunning miniature portraits produced by its legendary artists, to the paper that scholars wrote on. A beautifully considered work written by Simi N&#299;sh&#257;p&#363;r&#299;, a librarian from Mashad in eastern Iran around 1400, records in careful detail the advice of a book lover who shared his passion. Anyone thinking of writing, he counsels solemnly, should be advised that the best paper for calligraphy is produced in Damascus, Baghdad or Samarkand. Paper from elsewhere "is generally rough, blotches and is impermanent." Bear in mind, he cautions, that it is worth giving paper a slight tint before committing ink to it, "because white is hard on the eyes and the master calligraphic specimens that have been observed have all been on tinted paper."<BR><BR>Places whose names are all but forgotten once dominated, such as Merv, described by one tenth-century geographer as a "delightful, fine, elegant, brilliant, extensive and pleasant city," and "the mother of the world"; or Rayy, not far from modern Teheran, which to another writer around the same time was so glorious as to be considered "the bridegroom of the earth" and the world's "most beautiful creation." Dotted across the spine of Asia, these cities were strung like pearls, linking the Pacific to the Mediterranean.<BR><BR>Urban centres spurred each other on, with rivalry between rulers and elites prompting ever more ambitious architecture and spectacular monuments. Libraries, places of worship, churches and observatories of immense scale and cultural influence dotted the region, connecting Constantinople to Damascus, Isfahan, Samarkand, Kabul and Kashgar. Cities such as these became home to brilliant scholars who advanced the frontiers of their subjects. The names of only a small handful are familiar today--men like Ibn S&#299;n&#257;, better known as Avicenna, al-B&#299;r&#363;n&#299; _and al-Khw&#257;rizmi--giants in the fields of astronomy and medicine; but there were many more besides. For centuries before the early modern era, the intellectual centres of excellence of the world, the Oxfords and Cambridges, the Harvards and Yales, were not located in Europe or the west, but in Baghdad and Balkh, Bukhara and Samarkand.<BR><BR>There was good reason why the cultures, cities and peoples who lived along the Silk Roads developed and advanced: as they traded and exchanged ideas, they learnt and borrowed from each other, stimulating further advances in philosophy, the sciences, language and religion. Progress was essential, as one of the rulers of the kingdom of Zhao in north-eastern China at one extremity of Asia more than 2,000 years ago knew all too well. "A talent for following the ways of yesterday," declared King Wu-ling in 307 bc, "is not sufficient to improve the world of today." Leaders in the past understood how important it was to keep up with the times.<BR><BR>The mantle of progress shifted, however, in the early modern period as a result of two great maritime expeditions that took place at the end of the fifteenth century. In the course of six years in the 1490s, the foundations were laid for a major disruption to the rhythm of long-established systems of exchange. First Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic, paving the way for two great land masses that were hitherto untouched to connect to Europe and beyond; then, just a few years later, Vasco da Gama successfully navigated the southern tip of Africa, sailing on to India, opening new sea routes in the process. The discoveries changed patterns of interaction and trade, and effected a remarkable change in the world's political and economic centre of gravity. Suddenly, western Europe was transformed from its position as a regional backwater into the fulcrum of a sprawling communication, transportation and trading system: at a stroke, it became the new mid-point between east and west.<BR><BR>The rise of Europe sparked a fierce battle for power--and for control of the past. As rivals squared up to each other, history was reshaped to emphasise the events, themes and ideas that could be used in the ideological clashes that raged alongside the struggle for resources and for command of the sea lanes. Busts were made of leading politicians and generals wearing togas to make them look like Roman heroes of the past; magnificent new buildings were constructed in grand classical style that appropriated the glories of the ancient world as their own direct antecedents. History was twisted and manipulated to create an insistent narrative where the rise of the west was not only natural and inevitable, but a continuation of what had gone before.<BR><BR>Many stories set me on the path to looking at the world's past in a different way. But one stood out in particular. Greek mythology had it that Zeus, father of the gods, released two eagles, one at each end of the earth, and commanded them to fly towards each other. A sacred stone, the omphalos--the navel of the world--was placed where they met, to enable communication with the divine. I learnt later that the concept of this stone has long been a source of fascination for philosophers and psychoanalysts.<BR><BR>I remember gazing at my map when I first heard this tale, wondering where the eagles would have met. I imagined them taking off from the shores of the western Atlantic and the Pacific coast of China and heading inland. The precise position changed, depending where I placed my fingers to start measuring equal distances from east and west. But I always ended up somewhere between the Black Sea and the Himalayas. I would lie awake at night, pondering the map on my bedroom wall, Zeus' eagles and the history of a region that was never mentioned in the books that I read--and did not have a name.<BR><BR>Not so long ago, Europeans divided Asia into three broad zones--the Near, Middle and Far East. Yet whenever I heard or read about present-day problems as I was growing up, it seemed that the second of these, the Middle East, had shifted in meaning and even location, being used to refer to Israel, Palestine and the surrounding area, and occasionally to the Persian Gulf. And I could not understand why I kept being told of the importance of the Mediterranean as a cradle of civilisation, when it seemed so obvious that this was not where civilisation had really been forged. The real crucible, the "Mediterranean" in its literal meaning--the centre of the world--was not a sea separating Europe and North Africa, but right in the heart of Asia.<BR><BR>My hope is that I can embolden others to study peoples and places that have been ignored by scholars for generations by opening up new questions and new areas of research. I hope to prompt new questions to be asked about the past, and for truisms to be challenged and scrutinised. Above all, I hope to inspire those who read this book to look at history in a different way.<BR><BR>Worcester College, Oxford<BR>April 2015

"A book not to be missed, just plain good reading about the drama of the Kids next door turning their dreams into millions." -The New York Times "Swaine and Freiberger capture the communal spirit of the early computer clubs, the brilliance and blundering of some of the first start-up companies, the assortment of naiveté, noble purpose and greed that characterized various pioneers, and the inevitable transformation of all this into a major industry. Must reading." -Philip Lemmons, editor-in-chief, BYTE Magazine<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>In the early 1970s, while Silicon Valley was designing the latest generation of digital wristwatches and pocket calculators, a ragtag group of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics hobbyists were busy creating the future in their garages. What they built was the personal computer, but what they were aiming for was something much more ambitious: a revolution. Fire in the Valley is the story of their efforts, and in particular, the contributions of an informal think tank called the Homebrew Computer Club. Its technically gifted community, comprising sci-fi aficionados and Berkeley counterculturists, believed computers could usher in an age of human empowerment, perhaps even a utopia.<BR><BR>The club's most famous member is Steve Jobs of Apple, whose story is told here, as is Bill Gates's, who was strongly influenced by Homebrew. What sets Fire in the Valley apart from the many other books about early days at Apple and Microsoft, though, is its focus on the brilliant engineers and coders who built the foundation that would eventually support those two companies. They included ex-Berkley Barb editor and hardware designer Lee Felsenstein, who was adamant about using computers for populist ends; Adam Osborne, who took PCs to the next level by making them portable; hacker legend John "Captain Crunch" Draper, who used telephony for his own mischievous purposes; and activist Ted Nelson, the Thom Paine of the computer revolution.<BR><BR>The cast of characters is sometimes tough to keep track of, and authors Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine have wisely included a graphic timeline in the first pages of the book that readers will find useful. It stretches from 1800 to 1999, encompassing events that have occurred since Fire in the Valley's original 1984 publication. This second edition includes new chapters and photographs to document the last 15 years, but they serve as more of an epilogue than a new act in this drama.

All rights reserved.<BR>Introduction<BR>Homesteading is about creating a lifestyle that is first of all genuine. It's about learning to recognize your needs--including energy, food, financial, and health needs--and finding out how they can be met creatively and responsibly. In order to harness your own energy for heat or electricity, you first have to face the facts about how much energy you use versus how much you actually need, and then assess your environment and resources to determine the best method for meeting those needs. Before buying chicks or any other animal to raise, be honest with yourself about the time you have to invest in caring for them. If you want a garden, there's no reason not to have one--but think about how large a plot you can manage before you start digging up dirt. Homesteading is different for every individual or family. Sometimes being genuine means letting go--at least temporarily--of grandiose schemes for acres of land, a home that is completely off the grid, and a barn full of animals. It could mean simply shopping at the local farmers' market for your produce, or making candles to light in the evenings to conserve electricity. If you live in an urban apartment, maybe you can plant vegetables on your roof, or start a community garden in a park or at a school. This book is meant for everyone who has a desire to be a responsible steward of our natural resources, whether living in the heart of the city or on a hundred acres of farmland in rural Vermont. It's meant to give you inspiration, information, and the basic directions you need to take a few steps closer to a healthier, happier, and more responsible lifestyle. From sprouting seeds to making a solar water heater to handcrafting paper to brewing herbal teas, you'll find more ideas than you'll ever be able to put into practice in one lifetime. But even if you only try one of the projects here, you'll have learned something new and experienced a different way of being, which hopefully you'll find enriching. Most importantly, you'll have had an opportunity to learn something about yourself and what homesteading means to you.<BR><BR>The Home Garden<BR><BR>"My green thumb came only as a result of the mistakes I made while learning to see things from the plant's point of view." <BR><BR>--H. Fred Ale<BR><BR>Creating a garden--whether it's a single tomato plant in a pot on your windowsill or a full acre chock-full of flowers and veggies--takes imagination, hard work, a bit of planning, patience, and a willingness to take risks. There are some factors you can control, like the condition of the soil you bury your seeds in, the time of year you start planting, and what plants you put where. But there will always be situations you can't predict; you might get a frost in June, an old discarded pumpkin seed might sprout up in the middle of your magnolias, or the cat could knock your basil plant off the counter to its demise on the kitchen floor. This element of surprise is one of the joys and challenges of gardening. If you can learn to skillfully navigate the factors in your control and accept the unpredictable circumstances with patience and a sense of humor, you'll have mastered a great life lesson. The following pages are meant to help you with that first part: gaining the knowledge and insight you need to give your garden the best chance of thriving. From understanding a plant's basic needs, to properly preparing soil, to protecting against weeds and harmful insects, this section covers all the gardening basics. Beyond that, you'll find information on growing plants without soil, tips for keeping your garden organic, and inspiration for gardening in urban environments. There is little in life as rewarding as enjoying a salad composed entirely of things you've picked from your own garden. But gardening is also about the process: If you can learn to love the feel of the dirt between your fingers, the burn in your muscles as you dig, and the quiet, slow way in which sprouts reach toward the sun, no moment of your labor will have been a waste, regardless of the end results.<BR><BR>Planning a Garden<BR><BR>Basic Plant<BR>Requirements<BR><BR>Before you start a garden, it's helpful to understand what plants need to thrive. Some plants, like dandelions, are tolerant of a wide variety of conditions, while others, such as orchids, have very specific requirements in order to grow successfully.&#8239;Before spending time, effort, and money attempting to grow a new plant in a garden, do some research to learn about the conditions that a particular plant needs to grow properly.<BR><BR>Environmental factors play a key role in the proper growth of plants. Some of the essential factors that influence this natural process are as follows:<BR><BR>1. Length of Day<BR><BR>The amount of time between sunrise and sunset is the most critical factor in regulating vegetative growth, blooming, flower development, and the initiation of dormancy. Plants utilize increasing day length as a cue to promote their growth in spring, while decreasing day length in fall prompts them to prepare for the impending cold weather. Many plants require specific day length conditions in order to bloom and flower.<BR><BR>2. Light<BR><BR>Light is the energy source for all plants. Cloudy, rainy days or any shade cast by nearby plants and structures can significantly reduce the amount of light available to the plant. In addition, plants adapted to thrive in shady spaces cannot tolerate full sunlight. In general, plants will only survive where adequate sunlight reaches them at levels they are able to tolerate. <BR><BR>3. Temperature<BR><BR>Plants grow best within an optimal range of temperatures. This temperature range may vary drastically depending on the plant species. Some plants thrive in environments where the temperature range is quite wide; others can only survive within a very narrow temperature variance. Plants can only survive where temperatures allow them to carry on life-sustaining chemical reactions.<BR><BR>4. Cold<BR><BR>Plants differ by species in their ability to survive cold temperatures. Temperatures below 60°F injure some tropical plants. Conversely, arctic species can tolerate temperatures well below zero. The ability of a plant to withstand cold is a function of the degree of dormancy present in the plant, its water status, and its general health. Exposure to wind, bright sunlight, or rapidly changing temperatures can also compromise a plant's tolerance to the cold.<BR><BR>5. Heat<BR><BR>A plant's ability to tolerate heat also varies widely from species to species. Many plants that evolved to grow in arid, tropical regions are naturally very heat tolerant, while sub-arctic and alpine plants show very little tolerance for heat.&#8239;<BR><BR>6. Water<BR><BR>Different types of plants have different water needs. Some plants can tolerate drought during the summer but need winter rains to flourish. Other plants need a consistent supply of moisture to grow well. Careful attention to a plant's need for supplemental water can help you to select plants that need a minimum of irrigation to perform well in your garden. If you have poorly drained, chronically wet soil, you can select garden plants that naturally grow in bogs, marshlands, and other wet places.<BR><BR>7. Soil pH<BR><BR>A plant root's ability to take up certain nutrients depends on the pH--a measure of the acidity or alkalinity--of your soil. Most plants grow best in soils that have a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Ericaceous plants, such as azaleas and blueberries, need acidic soils with a pH below 6.0 to grow well. Lime can be used to raise the soil's pH, and materials containing sulfates, such as aluminum sulfate and iron sulfate, can be used to lower the pH. The solubility of many trace elements is controlled by pH, and plants can only use the soluble forms of these important micronutrients.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>The definitive history of America's greatest incubator of innovation and the birthplace of some of the 20th century's most influential technologies<BR><BR>From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT&T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it's hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn't been touched by Bell Labs. In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century's most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Jon Gertner grew up in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, just a few hundred yards away from Bell Labs. He has been a writer for the New York Times Magazine since 2004 and is an editor at Fast Company magazine. He lives in Maplewood, New Jersey, with his wife and two children.

Scores to Settle brings classical music to life through stories about the struggle to create and perform it. Following Grace Notes for a Year, Norman Gilliland's popular earlier book of musical anecdotes, Scores to Settle brings together 366 brief true stories ranging from the inspirational to the burlesque, all of them illuminating the musical experience for composers, musicians, and listeners.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"I really enjoyed reading this book. There are many wonderful anecdotes that give great insight into these composers and many of the events that shaped their lives and compositions. I highly recommend this book and wish its readers many enjoyable hours."--Edo de Waart<BR><BR>"Gilliland has done it again: This second installment of his wondrous compilation of anecdotes, both hilarious and richly informative, from the annals of music history. Musicians of all stripes-composers, conductors, divas, and divos, violinists, pianists, and bass trombonists-parade through the 366-pages (one for each day of the year, plus Leap Day) of this hefty tome. Some are so outrageously comical that you'll be ricocheting with laughter for days to come; others are so fascinatingly strange that you'll think the author made it all up. Hooray for humor and wit in music!"--Gunther Schuller

Synopsis:<BR><BR>A FINANCIAL TIMES BEST BOOK OF 2019<BR>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Outliers, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.<BR>How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<BR>While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout."<BR>Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five New York Times bestsellers--The Tipping Point, Blink,Outliers, What the Dog Saw, and David and Goliath. He is also the co-founder of Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that produces the podcasts Revisionist History, which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood, and Broken Record, where he, Rick Rubin, and Bruce Headlam interview musicians across a wide range of genres. Gladwell has been included in the TIME 100 Most Influential People list and touted as one of Foreign Policy's Top Global Thinkers.

Over 2 million copies sold! Used by thousands of companies and hundreds of business schools! Required reading for anyone in the Theory of Constraints. This book, which introduces the Theory of Constraints, is changing how America does business. The Goal is a gripping, fast-paced business novel about overcoming the barriers to making money. You will learn the fundamentals of identifying and solving the problems created by constraints. From the moment you finish the book you will be able to start successfully addressing chronic productivity and quality problems.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>A survey of the reading habits of managers found that though they buy books by the likes of Tom Peters for display purposes, the one management book they have actually read from cover to cover is The Goal.<BR>- Economist<BR><BR>Goldratt's system, in essence, forces production managers and workers<BR>alike to coordinate their work-with an underlying principle in mind: that 'bottlenecks'...are what ultimately constrain the manufacturing environment.<BR>- Business Week<BR><BR>This theory provided a persuasive solution for factories struggling with production delays and low revenues.<BR>- Harvard Business Review<BR><BR>Like Mrs. Fields and her cookies, The Goal was too tasty to remain obscure.

When his district manager tells him that profits must increase or the plant will be closed, Alex realizes he needs help. He turns to Jonah, a former professor, whom Alex discovers is now a management consultant (although Jonah's field is physics). With the help of the enigmatic Jonah and the plant staff, Alex turns the plant around while at the same time abandoning many management principles he previously thought were ironclad. This multivoiced presentation is lively and interesting and offers food for thought for managers in any field. The performances are natural and unaffected, with sound effects to enhance the illusion of reality. Although it is a novel, this title is more appropriate for business collections.-- Melody A. Moxley, Rowan P.L., Salisbury, N.C.<BR><BR>- Library Journal<BR><BR>'A survey of the reading habits of managers found that though they buy books by the likes of Tom Peters for display purposes, the one management book they have actually read from cover to cover is The Goal.'

Works Management ' Written in the style of a novel it treats the subject of ongoing personal development in a unique way. although the scene is set in a US manufacturing company it can easily be transferred to your business. You will learn as you read this story, recognizing the changes you need to make as you progress. Definitely a book to read...' The Hairdresser<BR>- From the Publisher<BR><BR>A novel, business lesson, and wake-up call for leaders whose companies are bogged down by complacency, sloppy thinking, and bureaucratic stupidity, this 1984 text is anchored by the comforting voice of Eric Conger and a strong cast of voice actors who handle the material with immense skill. They deftly balance between the need to jazz up the dry business content and the temptation to succumb to the story's melodrama. The heroic story line seems hindered by extraneous dialogue and subplots, but the voice performances make the production hard to fault as a listening experience. The main point is that companies are profitable when archaic habits are persistently reexamined with fresh eyes for constraints and bottlenecks.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>You have survived the crisis&#x2015;trauma, disease, accident, or war&#x2015;now how do you get your life back? The shark attacked while she was snorkeling, tearing through Micki Glenn's breast and shredding her right arm. Her husband, a surgeon, saved her life on the spot, but when she was safely home she couldn't just go on with her life. She had entered an even more profound survival journey: the aftermath.<BR><BR>The survival experience changes everything because it invalidates all your previous adaptations, and the old rules don't apply. In some cases survivors suffer more in the aftermath than they did during the actual crisis. In all cases, they have to work hard to reinvent themselves. Drawing on gripping cases across a wide range of life-threatening experiences, Laurence Gonzales fashions a compelling argument about fear, courage, and the adaptability of the human spirit. Micki Glenn was later moved to say: "I don't regret that this happened to me. [It] has been . . . probably the single most positive experience I've ever had."<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Laurence Gonzales is the author of Surviving Survival, Flight 232, and the bestseller Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why. He has won two National Magazine Awards and is a scholar at the Sante Fe Institute. He divides his time between Evanston, Illinois, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.

A gently guided, profusely illustrated Grand Tour of the world of mathematics.<BR><BR>This extraordinary work takes the reader on a long and fascinating journey--from the dual invention of numbers and language, through the major realms of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus, to the final destination of differential equations, with excursions into mathematical logic, set theory, topology, fractals, probability, and assorted other mathematical byways. The book is unique among popular books on mathematics in combining an engaging, easy-to-read history of the subject with a comprehensive mathematical survey text. Intended, in the author's words, "for the benefit of those who never studied the subject, those who think they have forgotten what they once learned, or those with a sincere desire for more knowledge," it links mathematics to the humanities, linguistics, the natural sciences, and technology.<BR><BR>Contains more than 1000 original technical illustrations, a multitude of reproductions from mathematical classics and other relevant works, and a generous sprinkling of humorous asides, ranging from limericks and tall stories to cartoons and decorative drawings. Over 1000 technical illustrations and cartoons and drawings<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>What does mathematics mean? Is it numbers or arithmetic, proofs or equations? Jan Gullberg starts his massive historical overview with some insight into why human beings find it necessary to "reckon," or count, and what math means to us. From there to the last chapter, on differential equations, is a very long, but surprisingly engrossing journey. Mathematics covers how symbolic logic fits into cultures around the world, and gives fascinating biographical tidbits on mathematicians from Archimedes to Wiles. It's a big book, copiously illustrated with goofy little line drawings and cartoon reprints. But the real appeal (at least for math buffs) lies in the scads of problems--with solutions--illustrating the concepts. It really invites readers to sit down with a cup of tea, pencil and paper, and (ahem) a calculator and start solving. Remember the first time you "got it" in math class? With Mathematics you can recapture that bliss, and maybe learn something new, too. Everyone from schoolkids to professors (and maybe even die-hard mathphobes) can find something useful, informative, or entertaining here. --Therese Littleton<BR><BR>From Scientific American<BR>The book is an enthusiastic and utterly amazing popularization that promises to be in print for decades.... It is an important reference and a book that is plain fun to dip into. If a family is to have only one mathematics book on the reference shelf, then this is the one.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>A long book on mathematics? No need to brace yourself for tedium. Whether counting on an abacus or solving triple integrals, Gullberg explains his subject with an infectious zeal--and an unpredictable sense of humor. The basic formulas are all here, making this an ideal reference for readers who cannot quite remember what they once learned about trigonometric functions or vector algebra. But beware! Those looking for quick help with a problem may find themselves diverted for many hours by the wealth of historical anecdotes, literary quotations, artwork, light verse, and even cartoons sprinkled liberally through the pages. Perhaps because he is himself a well-practiced amateur in the field rather than a professional, Gullberg anticipates perfectly the perplexities of the average reader. Simplified derivations and numerous examples will clear up most of the hard points. But the point Gullberg makes clearest of all is that mathematics can be very exciting and thoroughly enjoyable.

A DOCUMENT THAT SHAPED A NATION<BR><BR>An authoritative analysis of the Constitution of the United States and an enduring classic of political philosophy. <BR><BR>Written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, The Federalist Papers explain the complexities of a constitutional government--its political structure and principles based on the inherent rights of man. Scholars have long regarded this work as a milestone in political science and a classic of American political theory.<BR><BR>Based on the original McLean edition of 1788 and edited by noted historian Clinton Rossiter, this special edition includes:<BR><BR>&#9679; Textual notes and a select bibliography by Charles R. Kesler<BR>&#9679; Table of contents with a brief précis of each essay<BR>&#9679; Appendix with a copy of the Constitution cross-referenced to The Federalist Papers<BR>&#9679; Index of Ideas that lists the major political concepts discussed<BR>&#9679; Copies of The Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804) was born in the West Indies and served during the War of Independence as a captain. His military brilliance was recognized, and he was sent on several important military commissions. He was George Washington's secretary and aide-de-camp and in 1787 become a Member of the Constitutional Convention. From 1789 to 1795 he was the first Secretary of the Treasury, and in 1801 he held the casting vote against Burr and for Jefferson. He fought a duel with Burr and died the next day.<BR><BR>James Madison (1751-1836) was the fourth President of the United States and become known as the 'father' of the Constitution because of his influence in planning it and drawing up the Bill of Rights. He was Secretary of State under Jefferson, and his main achievement in this role was the purchase of Louisiana from the French. He lived in Montpelier, Virginia, for eighty-five years, two of which he spent on the governor's council. He was elected President in 1809 and again in 1812. During his terms in office he worked to abolish slavery, to disestablish the Church and to seek peace, although under his command the war against Britain resulted in a U.S. triumph.<BR><BR>John Jay (1745-1829) served the new nation in both law and diplomacy and established important judicial precedents as first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. A New York attorney from 1768, he won a wide reputation with The Address to the People of Great Britain, which stated the claims of the colonists. He did not sign the Declaration of Independence in 1776 but helped to ensure its approval in New York. In 1789 he was appointed the first U.S. Chief Justice and shaped the Supreme Court procedures. The Jay Treaty of 1794 with Great Britain made him unpopular, and his hopes of succeeding Washington as President faded. After a spell as Governor of New York he retired to a farm, where he spent twenty-seven uneventful years.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>The Federalist No. 1: Hamilton<BR><BR>October 27, 1787<BR><BR>To the People of the State of New York.<BR><BR>After an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting Federal Government, you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its own importance; comprehending in its consequences, nothing less than the existence of the Union, the safety and welfare of the parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire, in many respects, the most interesting in the world. It has been frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for their political constitutions, on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis, at which we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the æra in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part we shall act, may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind.<BR><BR>This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism to heighten the solicitude, which all considerate and good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiassed by considerations not connected with the public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected. The plan offered to our deliberations, affects too many particular interests, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices little favourable to the discovery of truth.<BR><BR>Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter, may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may hazard a diminution of the power, emolument and consequence of the offices they hold under the State-establishments-and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandise themselves by the confusions of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies, than from its union under one government.<BR><BR>It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views: Candour will oblige us to admit, that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted that much of the opposition which has made its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable, the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and so powerful are the causes, which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we upon many occasions, see wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions, of the first magnitude to society. This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those, who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right, in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect, might be drawn from the reflection, that we are not always sure, that those who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition, and many other motives, not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support as upon those who oppose the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing could be more illjudged than that intolerant spirit, which has, at all times, characterised political parties. For, in politics as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.<BR><BR>And yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications, that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude, that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts by the loudness of their declamations, and by the bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened zeal for the energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized, as the off-spring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty. An overscrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people, which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretence and artifice; the bait for popularity at the expence of public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand, that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten, that the vigour of government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and well informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. History will teach us, that the former has been found a much more certain road to the introduction of despotism, than the latter, and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number have begun their career, by paying an obsequious court to the people, commencing Demagogues and ending Tyrants.<BR><BR>In the course of the preceeding observations I have had an eye, my Fellow Citizens, to putting you upon your guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to your welfare by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my Countrymen, I own to you, that, after having given it an attentive consideration, I am clearly of opinion, it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced, that this is the safest course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I effect not reserves, which I do not feel. I will not amuse you with an appearance of deliberation, when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions, and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good intentions disdains ambiguity. I shall not however multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the depository of my own breast: My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They shall at least be offered in a spirit, which will not disgrace the cause of truth.<BR><BR>I propose in a series of papers to discuss the following interesting particulars-The utility of the Union to your political prosperity-The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union-The necessity of a government at least equally energetic with the one proposed to the attainment of this object-The conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government-Its analogy to your own state constitution-and lastly, The additional security, which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government, to liberty and to property.<BR><BR>In the progress of this discussion I shall endeavour to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance that may seem to have any claim to your attention.<BR><BR>It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the Union, a point, no doubt, deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every state, and one, which it may be imagined has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who oppose the new constitution, that the Thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole.1 This doctrine will, in all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative of an adoption of the new Constitution, or a dismemberment of the Union. It will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils and the probable dangers, to which every State will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Official U.S. edition with full color illustrations throughout.<BR><BR>New York Times Bestseller<BR><BR>A Summer Reading Pick for President Barack Obama, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg <BR><BR>From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity's creation and evolution--a #1 international bestseller--that explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be "human."<BR><BR>One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth. Yet today there is only one--homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?<BR><BR>Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.<BR><BR>Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?<BR><BR>Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem.<BR><BR>Review:<BR><BR>An Amazon Best Book of the Month for February 2015: Yuval Noah Harari has some questions. Among the biggest: How did Homo sapiens (or Homo sapiens sapiens , if you're feeling especially wise today) evolve from an unexceptional savannah-dwelling primate to become the dominant force on the planet, emerging as the lone survivor out of six distinct, competing hominid species? He also has some answers, and they're not what you'd expect. Tackling evolutionary concepts from a historian's perspective, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, describes human development through a framework of three not-necessarily-orthodox "Revolutions": the Cognitive, the Agricultural, and the Scientific. His ideas are interesting and often amusing: Why have humans managed to build astonishingly large populations when other primate groups top out at 150 individuals? Because our talent for gossip allows us to build networks in societies too large for personal relationships between everyone, and our universally accepted "imagined realities"--such as money, religion, and Limited Liability Corporations--keep us in line. Who cultivated whom, humans or wheat?. Wheat. Though the concepts are unusual and sometimes heavy (as is the book, literally) Harari's deft prose and wry, subversive humor make quick work of material prone to academic tedium. He's written a book of popular nonfiction (it was a bestseller overseas, no doubt in part because his conclusions draw controversy) landing somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of genetics, sociology, and history. Throughout, Harari returns frequently to another question: Does all this progress make us happier, our lives easier? The answer might disappoint you. --Jon Foro

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Stand aside, we're coming through! <BR><BR>That's the cry of a new generation of technology vendors. They have a new approach to enabling success for their customers. And they're thriving as a result. <BR><BR>These vendors all have subscription pricing at the heart of their business. Each has learned that if customers don't feel they've had success, recurring revenue doesn't grow and may even decline.<BR><BR>What makes them different? They have absolute clarity about what the customer considers success to be. And they've built their business around enabling that success. They know it's the outcomes for the customer that count. They're all members of the Outcome Generation.<BR><BR>This book shows how to join the Outcome Generation. You'll learn how to leverage true customer success at every stage of the customer lifecycle. For existing customers, you'll learn how to engage customer executives at the start of the buying cycle--and often create a buying cycle.<BR><BR>You'll learn how to increase new business (new logo) sales by employing the third generation of technology sales--selling outcomes. And exactly what type of outcome to sell. Using the third-generation approach, you'll create greater emotional connections, differentiate from the competition and win more business.<BR><BR>You'll also learn how to evolve Services and Support to focus on enabling true customer success, and how that's producing great references.<BR><BR>And Marketing will have a whole new way of attracting attention, creating interest and engaging prospects.<BR><BR>Most vendors have evolved past solution-selling and its approaches to marketing, sales, services and support. The Outcome Generation shows how to align the whole business around a common theme--enabling outcomes the customers regard as success. And why that allows vendors to thrive! Buy the book now and join the Outcome Generation.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Paul has been an evangelist on outcomes for over a decade. And with outcomes as the theme, he's written two books and developed a program for each book. Located in Sydney, Australia, Paul is now an author, speaker and consultant. Before this, he was the senior vice president of Asia-Pacific for an enterprise software company. He led 200 people in nine countries supporting 800 enterprise customers. His experience working across the region led to two insights on outcomes. First, many organisations struggled to make their strategies work. He saw two problems. The organisations launched strategies without first developing execution capability. And they didn't coordinate implementation activities across departments. He realised a focus on internal outcomes would address these problems. He coined the phrase 'execution outcomes'. And wrote his first book, 'The Chief Capability Officer - Delivering the Capability to Execute'. During this time, he had a related article, 'The Three Sins of ERP in Manufacturing', published in Industry Week. The second insight he gained - technology vendors weren't enabling outcomes the customers regarded as success. He decided his Asia Pacific team would do more to ensure the customers' success. So, he and his team pioneered an outcomes-based approach to customer engagement. They designed and ran the program across the entire Asia Pacific region. Paul and his team learnt what worked and what didn't work. Having run the outcomes program for more than five years, he realised his experience could help other technology vendors. He also realised the nascent customer success movement provided a great vehicle for enabling these outcomes. He spent over a year researching customer success. He then blended that research and his own experience to develop the Generation 3 Customer Success program and write his second book - The Outcome Generation - How a New Generation of Technology Vendors Thrive through True Customer Success. You can learn more about both programs and their associated programs at www.outcomeleaders.com.

All rights reserved.<BR>Introduction<BR><BR>Years ago at a science-fiction convention, I was flipping through the dollarÂ boxes at a dealer's table when this Hector Garrido cover for The LittleÂ People brought my eyeballs to a screeching halt. I wasn't a book collector--Â I didn't even know who Hector Garrido was--but I knew what this was:Â the Mona Lisa of paperback covers. I bought it so fast my fingers blistered. I neverÂ expected to actually read the book . . . but three months later, I fished it out of myÂ "To Be Read" pile and cracked it open.<BR>Â  Â  Â I knew John Christopher's name from his Tripods science-fiction series, whichÂ had been serialized as a comic strip in the back of Boys' Life magazine. But thisÂ 1966 Avon novel was stronger stuff. In it, a gorgeous secretary inherits an IrishÂ castle from a distant relative and converts it into a B&B to show her patronizingÂ lawyer/fianc. that she can stand on her own. On opening weekend, the house isÂ full of guests: an Irish dreamboat alcoholic, two bickering Americans with a hot-to-trot teenage daughter, and a married couple who met in a concentration camp,Â where he was a guard and she was a prisoner.<BR>Â  Â  Â But some uninvited guests are lurking in the basement: the Gestapochauns.<BR>Â  Â  Â The Gestapochauns live in the dark, battling their ancient rat enemies with teenyÂ bullwhips. Shortly after we meet them, the author lets us know that these are notÂ just any Nazi leprechauns. These are psychic Nazi leprechauns who enjoy S&M,Â are covered with scars from pleasure/pain sessions with their creator, were trainedÂ as sex slaves for full-sized human men, and are actually stunted fetuses taken fromÂ Jewish concentration camp victims. And one of them is named Adolph.<BR>Â  Â  Â While all this information is being hosed into the reader's eyes like a geyserÂ of crazy, this book rockets from 0 to 60 on the loony meter and overdelivers onÂ practically every level. From the moment the Gestapochauns play a mean practicalÂ joke on the old Irish washerwoman who works in the kitchen to the moment thatÂ the lawyer/fianc. realizes exactly what the Nazi leprechaun named Greta is up toÂ in his pants, it's one fifty-page freakout that's firing on every cylinder.<BR>Â  Â  Â Sadly, the Gestapochauns are completely absent from the last thirty pages ofÂ the book. The author devoted the remaining pages to a discrete psychic battle thatÂ takes place in the dreams of the non-psychic, non-Nazi, non-leprechaun membersÂ of the cast. In other words, the Boring People. Yet Christopher and his GestapochaunsÂ fly so high and so far in those middle passages that they practicallyÂ touch the sun.<BR>Â  Â  Â No matter what book I read next, the Gestaopchauns clung to my gray folds,Â whispering to me in my sleep: What else has been forgotten? After some latenightÂ googling brought me to Will Errickson's Too Much Horror Fiction blog,Â I blacked out. One year later, I woke up squatting in the middle of an aisle atÂ Sullivan's Trade-a-Book in the heart of South Carolina, surrounded by piles ofÂ musty horror paperbacks. Apparently I was buying them. Apparently I was readingÂ them. Apparently I was addicted.<BR>Â  Â  Â The books I love were published during the horror paperback boom thatÂ started in the late '60s, after Rosemary's Baby hit the big time. Their reign ofÂ terror ended in the early '90s, after the success of Silence of the Lambs convincedÂ marketing departments to scrape the word horror off spines and glue onÂ the word thriller instead. Like The Little People, these books had their flaws, butÂ they offered such wonders. When's the last time you read about Jewish monsterÂ brides, sex witches from the fourth dimension, flesh-eating moths, homicidalÂ mimes, or golems stalking Long Island? Divorced from current trends in publishing,Â these out-of-print paperbacks feel like a breath of fresh air. Get ready to meetÂ some of my new favorite writers: Elizabeth Engstrom. Joan Samson. Bari Wood.Â The Lovecraftian apocalypse of Brian McNaughton. The deeply strange alternateÂ universe of William W. Johnstone. Brenda Brown Canary, whose The Voice of theÂ Clown is one of the few books to actually make my jaw drop. You'll hear the darkÂ whisperings of Ken Greenhall, the gothic Southern twang of Michael McDowell,Â the clipped British accent of James Herbert, the visionary chants of Kathe Koja,Â and the clinical drone of Michael Blumlein.<BR>Â  Â  Â The book you're holding is a road map to the horror Narnia I found hidden inÂ the darkest recesses of remote bookstores--a weird, wild, wonderful world thatÂ feels totally alien today, and not just because of the trainloads of killer clowns.Â In these books from the '70s and '80s, doctors swap smokes with patients whileÂ going over their ultrasounds, housewives are diagnosed as having "too muchÂ imagination," African Americans are sometimes called "negroes," and parentsÂ swoon in terror at the suggestion that they have a "test tube baby."<BR>Â  Â  Â These books, written to be sold in drugstores and supermarkets, weren't worriedÂ about causing offense and possess a jocular, straightforward, "let's get it on"Â attitude toward sex. Many were published before the AIDS epidemic, at the heightÂ of the Swinging '70s, and they're unapologetic about the idea that adults don'tÂ need much of an excuse to take off their clothes and hop into bed.<BR>Â  Â  Â Though they may be consigned to dusty dollar boxes, these stories are timelessÂ in the way that truly matters: they will not bore you. Thrown into the rough-andtumble<BR>marketplace, the writers learned they had to earn every reader's attention.Â And so they delivered books that move, hit hard, take risks, go for broke. It's notÂ just the covers that hook your eyeballs. It's the writing, which respects no rulesÂ except one: always be interesting.<BR>Â  Â  Â So grab a flashlight and come wander down these dark aisles. The shelves areÂ dusty, the lighting is dim, and there's no guarantee you'll come back unchangedÂ or come back at all. All you need is a map and you're ready to take a tour of theÂ paperbacks from hell.<BR><BR>Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission.

Family members lived in close proximity to each other and were an important part of each other's lives. You had Sunday dinner at Nonno (Grandpa) and Nonna's (Grandma's) house every week -- if they didn't live with you already. If you got in trouble at school, your cousin Giovanni had already told your mother by the time you got home. You learned to respect your parents and grandparents and took care of them in their old age. Dinner conversation was lively and accompanied by shoving and teasing from your siblings and cousins. Your nonno took great pleasure in secretly giving you more almond cookies than your mother would allow.<BR><BR>Italian customs and holidays often evolved so they were part Italian, part American. A turkey may have appeared on the Christmas table, but so did your nonna's octopus pasta with gravy (spaghetti sauce), Zia (Aunt) Lucia's panella (a type of fried polenta), pannetoni (a sweet bread), and the chicken your zio (uncle) Batta brought to the back door of your grandparents' home a few hours before the meal. Maybe you celebrated the Feast of the Seven Fishes, a Christmas Eve tradition brought over from the old country. Or perhaps your ancestors crossed themselves repeatedly to ward off the malocchio (the evil eye), a superstition that a jealous or envious look from another person could cause physical harm.<BR><BR>All of this is part of Italian-American history, tradition, and culture. The sense of family and tradition is what we hope to keep alive for our children and grandchildren.<BR><BR>Our Italian ancestors often sacrificed a lot to immigrate to the United States, leaving behind their families and a life they would always miss. They (like my great-grandfather, Antonino Lo Schiavo in image A) worked hard, focused on their families, pressed onward when life presented difficulties, and made a better life for themselves and their descendants. All of this should make us proud of where we come from and truly grateful to those who came before.<BR><BR>This guide is designed to help you honor and celebrate your ancestors' legacy. While this book is not exhaustive, it will cover key resources and information you need to research your Italian ancestors. Through your research, you will learn more about Italian history, genealogy, and your cultural legacy than you ever believed possible. By the end of this book, I believe your Italian blood will be 'singing in your veins.'<BR><BR>In this chapter, we'll discuss some of the important facets of Italian- American culture, plus the major immigration trends you can expect to see.<BR><BR>Andiamo! (Let's go! Let's get started!)<BR><BR>ITALIAN IMMIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS<BR><BR>Italian immigrants have always been part of the United States' ethnic makeup, but Italians didn't arrive in large numbers until the 1850s. The earliest immigrants were often artisans or laborers recruited by US railroads, mining companies, and other large manufacturers for a certain job as the western part of the United States was settled. Most of these emigrants came from northern areas of Italy, and they sought opportunities to open businesses and own land in the United States and Latin American countries.<BR><BR>The major wave of Italian immigration to the United States occurred between 1880 and 1924, when the United States accepted nearly four million immigrants from Italy. Most came in through the ports of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and New Orleans, although you will find significant Italian immigration into other US ports, such as Baltimore and Los Angeles. Many of these immigrants settled in large cities, where jobs were plentiful and living conditions, less costly, particularly after 1890. Others intimidated by the hustle and bustle of city life moved to outlying towns after a few years of city living. Some were even bound for jobs in Montana or California, depending on where other immigrants from their town or province had already settled.<BR><BR>Most Italian emigrants from 1880 to 1910 were driven from their homeland by poverty and lack of jobs. Changes in property and inheritance laws and the entrenched feudalism in many areas of the country prompted the lower classes to emigrate. With no possibilities of getting a job, they had to find a way to put food on the table and provide for their families.<BR><BR>Some countries (like Argentina) needed settlers to colonize the vast amount of unsettled land and sent representatives to Italy to recruit immigrants with the promise of free land, an attractive offer considering nearly 80 percent of nineteenth-century Italians worked in the agricultural industry. The ability to own land -- especially enough to support your family -- was a key factor in many immigrants' decision to leave their home country.<BR><BR>Some Italian immigrants intended their stays to be temporary, either for a season or for a particular job. Their plans were then to return to Italy, often with enough money to support their families and perhaps buy a little plot of land. These men were called 'birds of passage,' many going back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean several times over the years.<BR><BR>While most left the homeland for economic reasons, other Italians emigrated to avoid mandatory military conscription. Those from the southern areas of the mainland and Sicilia (Sicily), especially, felt little loyalty to the national government, which continued some of the same policies after Italian Unification (see chapter 4) that had kept the working class in poverty for many years.<BR><BR>Prior to 1880, more immigrants came from the northern provinces, usually emigrating through the ports of Genoa, Italy, or Le Havre, France (image B), but the bulk of Italian immigrants were southern Italians seeking economic opportunities. After 1880, most Italian immigrants came from southern Italy and Sicilia (historically the poorest regions of modern Italy), emigrating from the port of Napoli. In fact, statistics show that eighty percent of the United States' total Italian immigration came from southern Italy and Sicilia.<BR><BR>At the time, US lawmakers were concerned that immigrants, Italian or otherwise, would become public charges immediately upon entering the United States. As a result, they crafted immigration law that attempted to ensure Italian immigrants were financially soluble. Immigrants were required to state the amount of money in their possession, the name of the person they were going to stay with, and where that person resided. Each immigrant also needed a sponsor, someone willing to support them financially until they were able to find jobs and support themselves. This was often a family member, be it a sibling or distant cousin. This helped ensure the immigrant had sufficient financial means or support.<BR><BR>Immigrants also received a thorough physical at their port of entry, and those who didn't pass because of a physical ailment were sent back on the next ship heading to Italy. Others were detained until the ailment had abated. Records of those detained can be found amongst the immigration manifests, usually at the end of each ship's passenger list.<BR><BR>The immigrants' life experiences and where in Italy they originated influenced their decisions about how to live in the new country. According to historian Edward C. Stibili in a 1987 article for the U.S. Catholic Historian:<BR><BR>The culture of the southern Italian peasant has been described by scholars as characterized by religious syncretism, campanilismo (village-mindedness), and amoral familialism ... Loyalty to the paese (country) and local saints were overshadowed by loyalty to the peasant's immediate family. The family gave the individual both status and a measure of security.<BR><BR>It wasn't until 1869 that Italy began to record the numbers of emigrating Italians. Initially, most were headed for temporary employment in other parts of Europe and South America, where they did not intend to settle permanently. (See the International Italian Immigration sidebar for more.) Their focus shifted to the United States around 1880. J.T. Senner wrote in an 1896 article for the North American Review:<BR><BR>As long as the migration to and from was entirely unrestricted [by the Italian government], Italians in large numbers were in the habit of crossing and recrossing the ocean, some as many as ten times, as so called 'birds of passage' and taking out of the United States, or other countries of [North] America, the gains which their standard of living, far below that of an American wage earner, made it easy for them to accumulate.<BR><BR>Initially, living conditions for immigrants were poor, but they quickly improved so much that they exceeded what the immigrant had left behind. Italian immigrants often lived quite modestly during the first few years, as they saved enough money to support their families back home or for purchasing tickets so the rest of their family could join them in America. Even some immigrants who didn't originally intend to stay in the Americas wound up sending for family members to permanently join them. According to Senner:<BR><BR>Quite a large proportion of those who originally came to the United States with no intention of acquiring residence, found the country so advantageous and congenial to them that they changed their minds, sent for their families, and settled permanently within the United States, acquiring, in time, rights of citizenship.<BR><BR>Unlike records from some European ports, Italian emigration resources (except for passenger lists, which came with immigrants and are held at American repositories) were largely destroyed. Italian officials felt they had no historical value, and thus the passenger lists, passports (or documents needed to get them), and ship passenger tickets found in a family's possession are the only likely source of emigration information on an Italian ancestor. We'll talk more about these resources in chapter 2.<BR><BR>ITALIAN-AMERICAN LIFE: LA FAMIGLIA (THE FAMILY)<BR><BR>For Italians and those of Italian descent, la famiglia, or 'the family,' has always been the most important social unit, putting focus on family, church, and community. Immigration to other countries was often the only means of providing for and protecting their families when jobs and opportunities were lacking. Starvation was a reality in the lives of many Italians prior to emigration, and it was a powerful motivator when it came time to decide whether or not to emigrate. They made great sacrifices so we could have the lives we enjoy now. America, after all, is the land of opportunity, and a gift we often take for granted.<BR><BR>While some Italian immigrants knew they were immigrating permanently, others intended their time in America to be temporary. These immigrants were called 'birds of passage,' hard-working Italians who immigrated with the season or for a particular job and intended to return home to Italy. They moved back and forth between countries with the seasons, as new opportunities arose, or as more money was needed to support their families, buy land, pay taxes, etc.<BR><BR>Similarly, many immigrants practiced chain migration, a system of sponsorship amongst family and friends. The father of a family usually came first, followed by an eldest son and (eventually) the rest of the family. However, if an immigration was intended to be temporary, the father and eldest son might immigrate at the same time, enabling them to save double the money.<BR><BR>Some immigrants eventually became disillusioned with America. In his book La Merica (Temple University, 2003), Michael La Sorte writes:<BR><BR>Disillusionment could come in a variety of forms. Many Italians demanded more of America than America was willing or able to give. Men came to America under the impression that they would be employed in a job of their own choosing the day they landed. Farmers who sought to manage a farm were informed that Italian farm managers simply did not exist. Those with training from technical schools in Italy did not find jobs commensurate with their talents. Others had great difficulty making the necessary adjustments to American culture.<BR><BR>However, despite the difficulties, what immigrants found in the New World was usually far better then what they left behind in the old country. Those who chose to settle permanently in the United States worked hard to create lives for themselves (image C).<BR><BR>In many Italian immigrant families, it was common for couples to speak Italian (or their local dialect) amongst themselves at home but to insist their American-born children speak and learn only English. This was their way of ensuring that their American-born children would have as many advantages as possible, many of which were not possible for the average person in Italy.<BR><BR>Extended family members settled close to each other or remained close despite their town of residence within the United States. Cousins of all levels (first, second, third) knew each other and grew up knowing they had an extended family unit to rely on when things got tough. Reliance on public charity was considered disgraceful unless there were absolutely no family members left to depend on.<BR><BR>Fraternal organizations dedicated to helping Italian-Americans begin their lives in the United States began to appear in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Membership dues supported these organizations, which provided help to new immigrants and served as a connection to their homeland. Many Italian immigrants purchased life insurance policies through their fraternal organizations, as an assurance that their families would receive some sort of financial assistance were they to pass away. The Order Sons of Italy in America and the Sons of Columbus were two such organizations. However, smaller groups more specific to an Italian region or town also existed. For example, a Sicilian living in Pittsburgh in the early twentieth century could join the Unione Frattelanza Siciliana, or the Fraternal Sicilian Union, through which they enjoyed many benefits and could socialize with those from their area of the country.<BR><BR>Many of our ancestors married someone from the same town or region, even after immigrating to the United States (image D). This concept, known as campanilismo (or regionalism), was common because of the prevalent opinion that the bride's and groom's families should be well acquainted with one another. This practice served to strengthen family ties by expanding that all- important family unit who supported you in times of trouble.<BR><BR>KEYS TO SUCCESS<BR><BR>â¢ Learn the basics of Italian-American immigration. Knowing the broader cultural context surrounding your ancestor's decision to leave the country -- and researching the immigrant experience -- can inform and enrich your family stories, plus give you a greater appreciation for the hardships your ancestors experienced.<BR><BR>â¢ Consider searching for your immigrant ancestor in other countries that were popular destinations for Italian emigrants. Many emigrants who ended up in the United States first came through countries such as Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, chasing job opportunities.<BR><BR>â¢ Find clues to your Italian ancestry by asking questions about their everyday lives here in the United States. What foods did they eat? Did several generations live together? What Italian traditions did your family celebrate?<BR><BR>â¢ Research their lives after they arrived in the United States. What challenges did they face? Did they belong to a fraternal organization? Did they go back and forth to Italy several times before settling permanently in the United States? <BR>(Continues...)Excerpted from The Family Tree Italian Genealogy Guide by Melanie D. Holtz.

This was their way of ensuring that their American-born children would have as many advantages as possible, many of which were not possible for the average person in Italy.<BR><BR>Extended family members settled close to each other or remained close despite their town of residence within the United States. Cousins of all levels (first, second, third) knew each other and grew up knowing they had an extended family unit to rely on when things got tough. Reliance on public charity was considered disgraceful unless there were absolutely no family members left to depend on.<BR><BR>Fraternal organizations dedicated to helping Italian-Americans begin their lives in the United States began to appear in the mid- to late nineteenth century. Membership dues supported these organizations, which provided help to new immigrants and served as a connection to their homeland. Many Italian immigrants purchased life insurance policies through their fraternal organizations, as an assurance that their families would receive some sort of financial assistance were they to pass away. The Order Sons of Italy in America and the Sons of Columbus were two such organizations. However, smaller groups more specific to an Italian region or town also existed. For example, a Sicilian living in Pittsburgh in the early twentieth century could join the Unione Frattelanza Siciliana, or the Fraternal Sicilian Union, through which they enjoyed many benefits and could socialize with those from their area of the country.<BR><BR>Many of our ancestors married someone from the same town or region, even after immigrating to the United States (image D). This concept, known as campanilismo (or regionalism), was common because of the prevalent opinion that the bride's and groom's families should be well acquainted with one another. This practice served to strengthen family ties by expanding that all- important family unit who supported you in times of trouble.<BR><BR>KEYS TO SUCCESS<BR><BR>â¢ Learn the basics of Italian-American immigration. Knowing the broader cultural context surrounding your ancestor's decision to leave the country -- and researching the immigrant experience -- can inform and enrich your family stories, plus give you a greater appreciation for the hardships your ancestors experienced.<BR><BR>â¢ Consider searching for your immigrant ancestor in other countries that were popular destinations for Italian emigrants. Many emigrants who ended up in the United States first came through countries such as Canada, Brazil, and Argentina, chasing job opportunities.<BR><BR>â¢ Find clues to your Italian ancestry by asking questions about their everyday lives here in the United States. What foods did they eat? Did several generations live together? What Italian traditions did your family celebrate?<BR><BR>â¢ Research their lives after they arrived in the United States. What challenges did they face? Did they belong to a fraternal organization? Did they go back and forth to Italy several times before settling permanently in the United States? <BR>(Continues...)Excerpted from The Family Tree Italian Genealogy Guide by Melanie D. Holtz.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>The great war epic of Western literature, translated by acclaimed classicist Robert Fagles, and featured in the Netflix series The OA<BR><BR>A Penguin Classic<BR><BR>Dating to the ninth century B.C., Homer's timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to the wrenching, tragic conclusion of the Trojan War. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace.<BR><BR>Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer's poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad's mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls "an astonishing performance."<BR><BR>This Penguin Classics Deluxe edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper.<BR><BR>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>The great epic of Western literature, translated by the acclaimed classicist Robert Fagles<BR><BR>A Penguin Classic<BR><BR>Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning modern-verse translation. "Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy." So begins Robert Fagles' magnificent translation of the Odyssey, which Jasper Griffin in the New York Times Book Review hails as "a distinguished achievement."<BR><BR>If the Iliad is the world's greatest war epic, the Odyssey is literature's grandest evocation of an everyman's journey through life. Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. In the myths and legends retold here,<BR><BR>Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb introduction and textual commentary provide insightful background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles's translation. This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the general reader, to captivate a new generation of Homer's students. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition features French flaps and deckle-edged paper.<BR><BR>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.<BR><BR>Review:<BR><BR>Robert Fagles's translation is a jaw-droppingly beautiful rendering of Homer's Odyssey, the most accessible and enthralling epic of classical Greece. Fagles captures the rapid and direct language of the original Greek, while telling the story of Odysseus in lyrics that ring with a clear, energetic voice. The story itself has never seemed more dynamic, the action more compelling, nor the descriptions so brilliant in detail. It is often said that every age demands its own translation of the classics. Fagles's work is a triumph because he has not merely provided a contemporary version of Homer's classic poem, but has located the right language for the timeless character of this great tale. Fagles brings the Odyssey so near, one wonders if the Hollywood adaption can be far behind. This is a terrific book.

How can you believe all this stuff? This is the number-one question Catholics get asked and, sometimes, we ask ourselves. Why do we believe that God exists, that he became a man and came to save us, that what looks like a wafer of bread is actually his body? Why do we believe that he inspired a holy book and founded an infallible Church to teach us the one true way to live? Ever since he became Catholic, Trent Horn has spent a lot of time answering these questions, trying to explain to friends, family, and total strangers the reasons for his Catholic faith Some didn t believe in God, or even in the existence of truth. Others said they were spiritual but didn t think you needed religion to be happy. Some were Christians who thought Catholic doctrines over-complicated the pure gospel. And some were fellow Catholics who had a hard time understanding everything they professed to believe on Sunday. Why We re Catholic assembles the clearest, friendliest, most helpful answers that Trent learned to give to all these people and more. Beginning with how we can know reality and ending with our hope of eternal life, it s the perfect way to help skeptics and seekers (or Catholics who want to firm up their faith) understand the evidence that bolsters our belief and brings us joy.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>If you ve ever wondered why Catholics believe what they do, Trent s book is the ideal resource to find the answers. With great clarity and charity, he walks the reader through the most common objections and questions people have about Catholicism. Whether you re a Catholic looking to deepen your faith or you re curious about the claims made by the Church, you need to read Why We re Catholic. --Jason Evert, author of Saint John Paul the Great: His Five Loves<BR><BR>RCIA teachers should consider gifting a copy to every candidate and catechumen, and every priest and deacon should keep a stack of these books on his desk, as a ready handout. Why We re Catholic must find a home on every Catholic s bookshelf; I promise you, it will gather no dust. --Leila Miller - blogger<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Trent Horn is a staff apologist for Catholic Answers who specializes in teaching Catholics to graciously and persuasively engage those who disagree with them. Trent has a master's degree in theology from Franciscan University of Steubenville and is currently pursuing a graduate degree in philosophy from Holy Apostles College. He is the author of three books: Answering Atheism, Persuasive Pro-life, and Hard Sayings: A Catholic Approach to Answering Bible Difficulties.

Following on from Hung, Drawn and Executed, this second volume showcasing the work of Graham Humphreys contains almost 100 new paintings, many of them created during the pandemic. <BR><BR>With home entertainment playing such a crucial role during the Covid years, Graham found himself busier than ever and with increased focus. From Blu-ray reissues to soundtrack LP covers, and book jackets to private commissions, this new work is among the artist's best yet. Classic horror, independent films, and reimaginings of cult movie posters, it's all here!<BR><BR>All the work featured was painted in the traditional medium of gouache on watercolor paper, using techniques that Graham has refined over his 42 years as a professional illustrator. The book's title is a nod to the marketing of the famous movie franchise in which Graham was involved.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Graham immediately understood the essence of our film and painted an image that ripped up the traditions and threw the movie right in your face. I loved this poster!" --Sam Raimi, director, producer, screenwriter, actor<BR>Â <BR><BR>"Graham Humphreys' art is at once beautiful and transformative." --Clive Barker, screenwriter and novelist<BR>Â <BR><BR>"I've long been an admirer of Graham's wonderful artwork. For me, there's nothing that quite says HORROR like the queasy, lurid phantasms he conjures up with such wit, skill and imagination. I think I found the Evil Dead poster scarier than the film!" --Mark Gatiss, actor, screenwriter and novelist<BR>Â <BR><BR>"How do I love Graham Humphreys's artistry? Let me count the ways.Â The genre of horror, because of its examination of things dark and strange, demands a certain theatricality inÂ approach. And capturing the spirit and tone of a horror film in a single image such as a poster or DVD cover isÂ especially challenging. Time and again Graham's masterful art work meets and exceeds that challenge. HisÂ illustrations are consistently vivid, energetic and always convey an uncanny sense of motion and emotion. GrahamÂ Humphreys is at the pinnacle of his craft and I am so honored to have been the subject of a number of his." --Jeffrey Combs, author, Re-Animator<BR>Â <BR><BR>"One hundred seventy-six pages of iconic movie posters, illustrations and paintings . . . every work here deserves close inspection, and any fans of classic horror and sci-fi art will find loads to love. It's also great to see a contemporary artist resisting digital image creation and using the traditional medium of gouache to paint his images."Â  -This is Cool on Hung, Drawn and Executed: The Art of Graham Humphreys<BR>Â <BR><BR>"Not only does this book showcase Graham's amazing body of work, it includes a step-by-step breakdown of his painting process, which makes it invaluable to any budding artist." --Wolfbait on Hung, Drawn and Executed: The Art of Graham Humphreys<BR>Â <BR><BR>"With his distinctive but always innovative style, Humphreys could quite comfortably be termed the British Drew Struzan. This is a beautifully-presented testament to his art and is an essential purchase for any genre fan." --Starburst on Hung, Drawn and Executed: The Art of Graham Humphreys<BR>Â <BR><BR>"Hung, Drawn and Executed is a fascinating and delightful peek behind the curtain of all too often woefully ignored facet of one of the world's most beloved genres." -- Mass Movement on Hung, Drawn and Executed: The Art of Graham Humphreys<BR>Â <BR><BR>"For over forty years Graham Humphreys has been a fixture on the UK horror scene as an artist and designer. Hung, Drawn, and Executed is a wonderful introduction to Humphreys' signature colourful style that is both instantly recognizable and utterly stunning." --Screen Anarchy on Hung, Drawn and Executed: The Art of Graham Humphreys<BR>Â <BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Graham Humphreys is a British illustrator and film poster artist. Among his best-known works are the UK theatrical posters for The Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street and their various sequels. Instantly recognizable, Graham's output has expanded vastly since those early successes, and he remains busier today than ever before, with clients on both sides of the Atlantic. His current work includes LP soundtrack covers, book covers, film posters, Bluray sleeves, and privately commissioned re-imaginings of posters for classic fan favorites.<BR><BR>Rob Zombie has directed several horror films, including House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects and the 2007 reboot of Halloween. In addition, he has had a successful solo career as a singer and is the longtime frontman for industrial heavy metal superstars White Zombie.

<FONT SIZE="-1">
<P>
Synopsis:<BR><BR>By the author of the acclaimed bestsellers Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs, this is the definitive biography of Albert Einstein. <BR><BR>How did his mind work? What made him a genius? Isaacson's biography shows how his scientific imagination sprang from the rebellious nature of his personality. His fascinating story is a testament to the connection between creativity and freedom.<BR><BR>Based on newly released personal letters of Einstein, this book explores how an imaginative, impertinent patent clerk--a struggling father in a difficult marriage who couldn't get a teaching job or a doctorate--became the mind reader of the creator of the cosmos, the locksmith of the mysteries of the atom, and the universe. His success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marveling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a morality and politics based on respect for free minds, free spirits, and free individuals.<BR><BR>These traits are just as vital for this new century of globalization, in which our success will depend on our creativity, as they were for the beginning of the last century, when Einstein helped usher in the modern age.<BR><BR>Review:<BR><BR>As a scientist, Albert Einstein is undoubtedly the most epic among 20th-century thinkers. Albert Einstein as a man, however, has been a much harder portrait to paint, and what we know of him as a husband, father, and friend is fragmentary at best. With Einstein: His Life and Universe, Walter Isaacson (author of the bestselling biographies Benjamin Franklin and Kissinger) brings Einstein's experience of life, love, and intellectual discovery into brilliant focus. The book is the first biography to tackle Einstein's enormous volume of personal correspondence that heretofore had been sealed from the public, and it's hard to imagine another book that could do such a richly textured and complicated life as Einstein's the same thoughtful justice. Isaacson is a master of the form and this latest opus is at once arresting and wonderfully revelatory. --Anne Bartholomew<BR><BR>Read "The Light-Beam Rider," the first chapter of Walter Isaacson's Einstein: His Life and Universe. Five Questions for Walter Isaacson <BR><BR>Amazon.com: What kind of scientific education did you have to give yourself to be able to understand and explain Einstein's ideas?<BR><BR>Isaacson: I've always loved science, and I had a group of great physicists--such as Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, and Murray Gell-Mann--who tutored me, helped me learn the physics, and checked various versions of my book. I also learned the tensor calculus underlying general relativity, but tried to avoid spending too much time on it in the book. I wanted to capture the imaginative beauty of Einstein's scientific leaps, but I hope folks who want to delve more deeply into the science will read Einstein books by such scientists as Abraham Pais, Jeremy Bernstein, Brian Greene, and others.<BR><BR>Amazon.com: That Einstein was a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office when he revolutionized our understanding of the physical world has often been treated as ironic or even absurd. But you argue that in many ways his time there fostered his discoveries. Could you explain? <BR><BR>Isaacson: I think he was lucky to be at the patent office rather than serving as an acolyte in the academy trying to please senior professors and teach the conventional wisdom. As a patent examiner, he got to visualize the physical realities underlying scientific concepts. He had a boss who told him to question every premise and assumption. And as Peter Galison shows in Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps, many of the patent applications involved synchronizing clocks using signals that traveled at the speed of light. So with his office-mate Michele Besso as a sounding board, he was primed to make the leap to special relativity.<BR><BR>Amazon.com: That time in the patent office makes him sound far more like a practical scientist and tinkerer than the usual image of the wild-haired professor, and more like your previous biographical subject, the multitalented but eminently earthly Benjamin Franklin. Did you see connections between them?<BR><BR>Isaacson: I like writing about creativity, and that's what Franklin and Einstein shared. They also had great curiosity and imagination. But Franklin was a more practical man who was not very theoretical, and Einstein was the opposite in that regard. <BR><BR>Amazon.com: Of the many legends that have accumulated around Einstein, what did you find to be least true? Most true? <BR><BR>Isaacson: The least true legend is that he failed math as a schoolboy. He was actually great in math, because he could visualize equations. He knew they were nature's brushstrokes for painting her wonders. For example, he could look at Maxwell's equations and marvel at what it would be like to ride alongside a light wave, and he could look at Max Planck's equations about radiation and realize that Planck's constant meant that light was a particle as well as a wave. The most true legend is how rebellious and defiant of authority he was. You see it in his politics, his personal life, and his science.<BR><BR>Amazon.com: At Time and CNN and the Aspen Institute, you've worked with many of the leading thinkers and leaders of the day. Now that you've had the chance to get to know Einstein so well, did he remind you of anyone from our day who shares at least some of his remarkable qualities? <BR><BR>Isaacson: There are many creative scientists, most notably Stephen Hawking, who wrote the essay on Einstein as "Person of the Century" when I was editor of Time. In the world of technology, Steve Jobs has the same creative imagination and ability to think differently that distinguished Einstein, and Bill Gates has the same intellectual intensity. I wish I knew politicians who had the creativity and human instincts of Einstein, or for that matter the wise feel for our common values of Benjamin Franklin. <BR><BR>More to Explore

The Myths of Ancient Egypt are tied intimately to the presence and natural rhythms of the Nile. With their animalistic mythology, the Egyptians explained the effects of famine, harvest, floods and death by creating a pantheon of gods that still holds our fascination today. This new book of classic tales brings the stories of the ancients to life, from the birth of creation by Ra, the sun god, to the murder of Osiris, and the revenge of Horus. We gain glimpses of the underworld and the afterlife, as the rulers of Egypt claimed lineage from the Gods both worshipped and fashioned by the people of Egypt, at a time when humankind had begun to shape the world around it.<BR><BR>FLAME TREE 451: From mystery to crime, supernatural to horror and myth, fantasy and science fiction, Flame Tree 451 offers a healthy diet of werewolves and mechanical men, blood-lusty vampires, dastardly villains, mad scientists, secret worlds, lost civilizations and escapist fantasies.

Notes From Your Bookseller<BR><BR>For those of us interested in the cognitive process of everyday thoughts. In Thinking Fast & Slow, we are reminded that human reason is flawed and our minds often mislead us. Kahneman does a brilliant job explaining the two minds system in a manner that is clear, concise, and most importantly, approachable.<BR><BR>*Major New York Times Bestseller<BR>*More than 2.6 million copies sold<BR>*One of The New York Times Book Review's ten best books of the year<BR>*Selected by The Wall Street Journal as one of the best nonfiction books of the year<BR>*Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipient<BR>*Daniel Kahneman's work with Amos Tversky is the subject of Michael Lewis's best-selling The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds<BR><BR>In his mega bestseller, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman, world-famous psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. <BR><BR>System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation-each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.<BR><BR>Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives-and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Topping bestseller lists for almost ten years, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a contemporary classic, an essential book that has changed the lives of millions of readers.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>This book is a tour de force by an intellectual giant; it is readable, wise, and deep. Buy it fast. Read it slowly and repeatedly. It will change the way you think, on the job, about the world, and in your own life.<BR>- University of Chicago Professor of Economics and c Richard Thaler<BR><BR>Daniel Kahneman is one of the most original and interesting thinkers of our time. There may be no other person on the planet who better understands how and why we make the choices we make. In this absolutely amazing book, he shares a lifetime's worth of wisdom presented in a manner that is simple and engaging, but nonetheless stunningly profound. This book is a must read for anyone with a curious mind.<BR>- William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor o Steven D. Levitt<BR><BR>It is an astonishingly rich book: lucid, profound, full of intellectual surprises and self-help value. It is consistently entertaining . . . So impressive is its vision of flawed human reason that the New York Times columnist David Brooks recently declared that Kahneman and Tversky's work &#8216;will be remembered hundreds of years from now,' and that it is &#8216;a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.'"<BR>-Jim Holt, The New York Times Book Review <BR><BR>"There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality, but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow . . . This is one of the greatest and most engaging collections of insights into the human mind I have read."<BR>-William Easterly, Financial Times <BR><BR>"I will never think about thinking quite the same. [Thinking, Fast and Slow] is a monumental achievement."<BR>-Roger Lowenstein, Bloomberg/Businessweek <BR><BR>"Brilliant . . . It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Daniel Kahneman's contribution to the understanding of the way we think and choose. He stands among the giants, a weaver of the threads of Charles Darwin, Adam Smith and Sigmund Freud. Arguably the most important psychologist in history, Kahneman has reshaped cognitive psychology, the analysis of rationality and reason, the understanding of risk and the study of happiness and well-being."<BR>-Janice Gross Stein, The Globe and Mail <BR><BR>"Everyone should read Thinking, Fast and Slow."<BR>-Jesse Singal, Boston Globe<BR><BR>"[Thinking, Fast and Slow] is wonderful. To anyone with the slightest interest in the workings of his own mind, it is so rich and fascinating that any summary would seem absurd."<BR>-Michael Lewis, Vanity Fair<BR><BR>"Profound . . . As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch, Mr. Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be."<BR>-The Economist<BR><BR>"[A] tour de force of psychological insight, research explication and compelling narrative that brings together in one volume the high points of Mr. Kahneman's notable contributions, over five decades, to the study of human judgment, decision-making and choice . . . Thanks to the elegance and force of his ideas, and the robustness of the evidence he offers for them, he has helped us to a new understanding of our divided minds-and our whole selves."<BR>-Christoper F. Chabris, The Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"A major intellectual event . . . The work of Kahneman and Tversky was a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves."<BR>-David Brooks, The New York Times<BR><BR>"For anyone interested in economics, cognitive science, psychology, and, in short, human behavior, this is the book of the year. Before Malcolm Gladwell and Freakonomics, there was Daniel Kahneman, who invented the field of behavior economics, won a Nobel . . . and now explains how we think and make choices. Here's an easy choice: read this."<BR>-The Daily Beast<BR><BR>"Daniel Kahneman is one of the most original and interesting thinkers of our time. There may be no other person on the planet who better understands how and why we make the choices we make. In this absolutely amazing book, he shares a lifetime's worth of wisdom presented in a manner that is simple and engaging, but nonetheless stunningly profound.

Ogden Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago; co-author of Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics<BR><BR>"Thinking, Fast and Slow is a masterpiece-a brilliant and engaging intellectual saga by one of the greatest psychologists and deepest thinkers of our time. Kahneman should be parking a Pulitzer next to his Nobel Prize."<BR>-Daniel Gilbert, Harvard University Professor of Psychology, author of Stumbling on Happiness, host of the award-winning PBS television series "This Emotional Life"<BR><BR>"This is a landmark book in social thought, in the same league as The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud."<BR>-Nassim Taleb, author of The Black Swan<BR><BR>"Daniel Kahneman is among the most influential psychologists in history and certainly the most important psychologist alive today. He has a gift for uncovering remarkable features of the human mind, many of which have become textbook classics and part of the conventional wisdom. His work has reshaped social psychology, cognitive science, the study of reason and of happiness, and behavioral economics, a field that he and his collaborator Amos Tversky helped to launch. The appearance of Thinking, Fast and Slow is a major event."<BR>-Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of How the Mind Works and The Better Angels of our Nature<BR>- From the Publisher<BR><BR>...an astonishingly rich book: lucid, profound, full of intellectual surprises and self-help value. It is consistently entertaining and frequently touching...I overconfidently urge everyone to buy and read it.<BR>-The New York Times Book Review<BR>- Jim Holt<BR><BR>The mind is a hilariously muddled compromise between incompatible modes of thought in this fascinating treatise by a giant in the field of decision research. Nobel-winning psychologist Kahneman (Attention and Effort) posits a brain governed by two clashing decision-making processes. The largely unconscious System 1, he contends, makes intuitive snap judgments based on emotion, memory, and hard-wired rules of thumb; the painfully conscious System 2 laboriously checks the facts and does the math, but is so "lazy" and distractible that it usually defers to System 1. Kahneman uses this scheme to frame a scintillating discussion of his findings in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, and of the ingenious experiments that tease out the irrational, self-contradictory logics that underlie our choices. We learn why we mistake statistical noise for coherent patterns; why the stock-picking of well-paid investment advisers and the prognostications of pundits are worthless; why businessmen tend to be both absurdly overconfident and unwisely risk-averse; and why memory affects decision making in counterintuitive ways. Kahneman's primer adds to recent challenges to economic orthodoxies about rational actors and efficient markets; more than that, it's a lucid, marvelously readable guide to spotting--and correcting--our biased misunderstandings of the world. Photos. (Nov.)<BR>- Publishers Weekly<BR><BR>Kahneman (psychology, emeritus, Princeton) won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work with Amos Tversky on decision making. In this large, readable book, Kahneman presents provocative theories and groundbreaking research and, moreover, clearly explains both. He postulates two systems of thinking that operate simultaneously but often at odds: intuitive and deliberative, or fast and slow, respectively. Fast judgments dominate to a greater extent than we know and to our disadvantage. A key discovery that overcame an effect Kahneman terms "theory induced blindness" (which refers mainly to fast-thinking mistakes but can occur in slow thinking when our assumptions are wrong or simply interfere with seeing) was that outcomes are better defined by gains and losses than by sums of wealth. "Prospect theory," an idea Kahneman developed with Tversky, posits that, when all our options are bad, we tend to take riskier paths. With Kahneman's expert help, readers may understand this mix of psychology and economics better than most accountants, therapists, or elected representatives. VERDICT A stellar accomplishment, a book for everyone who likes to think and wants to do it better. [See Prepub Alert, 5/9/11]--E. James Lieberman, George Washington Univ. Sch. of Medicine, Washington, DC<BR>- Library Journal<BR><BR>Psychologist Kahneman's book examines our mental processes, with all the errors and foibles they're prey to. Narrator Patrick Egan has a likable voice, and he reads with energy at an excellent pace, modulating intonation and matching sense to expression skillfully. He makes the sometimes complex text clear and holds the listener's attention. But his precise articulation and almost exaggerated clarity often make his reading seem stiff and somewhat uncomfortable, more like a speech than a conversation. Though figures and charts referred to can be viewed as a PDF, frequent references to them may frustrate listeners, especially while in the middle of a task or driving. Still, this is an important book, and the reading itself is serviceable. W.M. © AudioFile 2012, Portland, Maine<BR>- JANUARY 2012 - AudioFile<BR><BR>A psychologist and Nobel Prize winner summarizes and synthesizes the recent decades of research on intuition and systematic thinking.<BR><BR>The author of several scholarly texts, Kahneman (Emeritus Psychology and Public Affairs/Princeton Univ.) now offers general readers not just the findings of psychological research but also a better understanding of how research questions arise and how scholars systematically frame and answer them. He begins with the distinction between System 1 and System 2 mental operations, the former referring to quick, automatic thought, the latter to more effortful, overt thinking. We rely heavily, writes, on System 1, resorting to the higher-energy System 2 only when we need or want to. Kahneman continually refers to System 2 as "lazy": We don't want to think rigorously about something. The author then explores the nuances of our two-system minds, showing how they perform in various situations. Psychological experiments have repeatedly revealed that our intuitions are generally wrong, that our assessments are based on biases and that our System 1 hates doubt and despises ambiguity. Kahneman largely avoids jargon; when he does use some ("heuristics," for example), he argues that such terms really ought to join our everyday vocabulary. He reviews many fundamental concepts in psychology and statistics (regression to the mean, the narrative fallacy, the optimistic bias), showing how they relate to his overall concerns about how we think and why we make the decisions that we do. Some of the later chapters (dealing with risk-taking and statistics and probabilities) are denser than others (some readers may resent such demands on System 2!), but the passages that deal with the economic and political implications of the research are gripping.<BR><BR>Striking research showing the immense complexity of ordinary thought and revealing the identities of the gatekeepers in our minds.<BR><BR>- Kirkus Reviews

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Space elevators. Internet-enabled contact lenses. Cars that fly by floating on magnetic fields. This is the stuff of science fiction--it's also daily life in the year 2100.<BR><BR>Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku details the developments in computer technology, artificial intelligence, medicine, space travel, and more, that are poised to happen over the next hundred years. He also considers how these inventions will affect the world economy, addressing the key questions: Who will have jobs? Which nations will prosper? Kaku interviews three hundred of the world's top scientists--working in their labs on astonishing prototypes. He also takes into account the rigorous scientific principles that regulate how quickly, how safely, and how far technologies can advance. In Physics of the Future, Kaku forecasts a century of earthshaking advances in technology that could make even the last centuries' leaps and bounds seem insignificant.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Michio Kaku is a professor of physics at the City University of New York, cofounder of string field theory, and the author of several widely acclaimed science books, including Hyperspace, Beyond Einstein, and Physics of the Impossible--the basis for his Science Channel TV show, Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible--and the host of two radio programs, Explorations and Science Fantastic.

When George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied--thanks in large part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy Ring. He realized that he couldn't defeat the British with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York.<BR><BR>Drawing on extensive research, Brian Kilmeade and Don Yaeger have offered fascinating portraits of these spies: a reserved Quaker merchant, a tavern keeper, a brash young longshoreman, a curmudgeonly Long Island bachelor, a coffeehouse owner, and a mysterious woman. Long unrecognized, the secret six are finally receiving their due among the pantheon of American heroes.

Now an AT&T Audience Original Series<BR><BR>WINNER OF THE EDGAR AWARD FOR BEST NOVEL<BR>#1 New York Times bestseller! In a high-suspense race against time, three of the most unlikely heroes Stephen King has ever created try to stop a lone killer from blowing up thousands. "Mr. Mercedes is a rich, resonant, exceptionally readable accomplishment by a man who can write in whatever genre he chooses" (The Washington Post).<BR><BR>In the frigid pre-dawn hours, in a distressed Midwestern city, desperate unemployed folks are lined up for a spot at a job fair. Without warning, a lone driver plows through the crowd in a stolen Mercedes, running over the innocent, backing up, and charging again. Eight people are killed; fifteen are wounded. The killer escapes.<BR><BR>In another part of town, months later, a retired cop named Bill Hodges is still haunted by the unsolved crime. When he gets a crazed letter from someone who self-identifies as the "perk" and threatens an even more diabolical attack, Hodges wakes up from his depressed and vacant retirement, hell-bent on preventing another tragedy.<BR><BR>Brady Hartsfield lives with his alcoholic mother in the house where he was born. He loved the feel of death under the wheels of the Mercedes, and he wants that rush again. Only Bill Hodges, with two new, unusual allies, can apprehend the killer before he strikes again. And they have no time to lose, because Brady's next mission, if it succeeds, will kill or maim thousands.<BR><BR>Mr. Mercedes is a war between good and evil, from the master of suspense whose insight into the mind of this obsessed, insane killer is chilling and unforgettable. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Pays off exuberantly... Surprising and invigorating." (Megan Abbott The New York Times)<BR><BR>"Classic Stephen King. Creepy, yet realistic characters that get under your skin and stay there, a compelling story that twists and turns at breakneck speed, and delightful prose that, once again, proves that one of America's greatest natural storytellers is also one of its finest writers."

An anthology of some twenty short works includes vampire thrillers, ingenious imitations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle mysteries, a teleplay from Tales of the Darkside, and a nonfiction Little League story, along with King's own reflections on his work. Reissue. (A TNT anthology series, airing Summer 2006, starring Tom Berenger, Kim Delaney, William Hurt, William H. Macy, Marsha Mason, Steven Weber, and others) (Horror) <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>Many people who write about horror literature maintain that mood is its most important element. Stephen King disagrees: "My deeply held conviction is that story must be paramount.... All other considerations are secondary--theme, mood, even characterization and language." <BR><BR>These fine stories, each written in what King calls "a burst of faith, happiness, and optimism," prove his point. The theme, mood, characters, and language vary, but throughout, a sense of story reigns supreme. Nightmares & Dreamscapes contains 20 short tales--including several never before published--plus one teleplay, one poem, and one nonfiction piece about kids and baseball that appeared in the New Yorker. The subjects include vampires, zombies, an evil toy, man-eating frogs, the burial of a Cadillac, a disembodied finger, and a wicked stepfather. The style ranges from King's well-honed horror to a Ray Bradbury-like fantasy voice to an ambitious pastiche of Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald. And like a compact disc with a bonus track, the book ends with a charming little tale not listed in the table of contents--a parable called "The Beggar and the Diamond." --Fiona Webster

In 1978 Stephen King introduced the world to the last Gunslinger, Roland of Gilead. Nothing has been the same since. Over twenty years later the quest for the Dark Tower continues to take readers on a wildly epic ride. Through parallel worlds and across time, Roland must brave desolate wastelands and endless deserts, drifting into the unimaginable and the familiar as the road to the Dark Tower extends beyond its own pages. A classic tale of colossal scope-crossing over terrain from The Stand, The Eyes of the Dragon, Insomnia, The Talisman, Black House, Hearts in Atlantis, 'Salem's Lot and other familiar King haunts-the adventure takes hold with the turn of each page.<BR><BR>And the tower awaits... <BR><BR>The First Volume in the Epic DARK TOWER Series...<BR><BR>The Gunslinger<BR><BR>This heroic fantasy is set in a world of ominous landscape and macabre menace that is a dark mirror of our own. A spellbinding tale of good versus evil, it features one of Stephen King's most powerful creations-The Gunslinger, a haunting figure who embodies the qualities of the lone hero through the ages, from ancient myth to frontier western legend.<BR><BR>The Gunslinger's quest involves the pursuit of The Man in Black, a liaison with the sexually ravenous Alice, and a friendship with the kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and eerily dreamlike, here is stunning proof of Stephen King's storytelling sorcery. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A compelling whirlpool of a story that draws one irretrievably to its center."-Milwaukee Sentinel<BR><BR>"Brilliant, fresh and compelling...will leave you panting for more."-Booklist<BR><BR>"An impressive work of mythic magnitude.

Tour of the whole horror genre in books, film, radio, and TV by the most popluar writer in the genre today. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>In the fall of 1978 (between The Stand and The Dead Zone), Stephen King taught a course at the University of Maine on "Themes in Supernatural Literature." As he writes in the foreword to this book, he was nervous at the prospect of "spending a lot of time in front of a lot of people talking about a subject in which I had previously only felt my way instinctively, like a blind man." The course apparently went well, and as with most teaching experiences, it was as instructive, if not more so, to the teacher as it was to the students. Thanks to a suggestion from his former editor at Doubleday, King decided to write Danse Macabre as a personal record of the thoughts about horror that he developed and refined as a result of that course.<BR><BR>The outcome is an utterly charming book that reads as if King were sitting right there with you, shooting the breeze. He starts on October 4, 1957, when he was 10 years old, watching a Saturday matinee of Earth vs. the Flying Saucers. Just as the saucers were mounting their attack on "Our Nation's Capital," the movie was suddenly turned off. The manager of the theater walked out onto the stage and announced, "The Russians have put a space satellite into orbit around the earth. They call it ... Spootnik."<BR><BR>That's how the whole book goes: one simple, yet surprisingly pertinent, anecdote or observation after another. King covers the gamut of horror as he'd experienced it at that point in 1978 (a period of about 30 years): folk tales, literature, radio, good movies, junk movies, and the "glass teat". It's colorful, funny, and nostalgic--and also strikingly intelligent. --Fiona Webster --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher-for that world or ours.<BR><BR>Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself-and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it.<BR><BR>Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world.<BR><BR>King's storytelling in Fairy Tale soars. This is a magnificent and terrifying tale in which good is pitted against overwhelming evil, and a heroic boy-and his dog-must lead the battle.<BR><BR>Early in the Pandemic, King asked himself: "What could you write that would make you happy?"<BR><BR>"As if my imagination had been waiting for the question to be asked, I saw a vast deserted city-deserted but alive. I saw the empty streets, the haunted buildings, a gargoyle head lying overturned in the street. I saw smashed statues (of what I didn't know, but I eventually found out). I saw a huge, sprawling palace with glass towers so high their tips pierced the clouds. Those images released the story I wanted to tell."<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>An Amazon Best Book of September 2022: Fairy Tale's protagonist Charlie Reade joins the ranks of King's best characters--like Gordie Lachance from The Body (which inspired the movie Stand By Me), or Roland Deschain from The Dark Tower. From the beginning, Charlie warns that the story he's about to tell is unbelievable, and it is. But, as is his way, King somehow makes us want to believe in this tale of a curmudgeonly neighbor with dangerous secrets, the siren song of glittering gold, a parallel world ruled by an unspeakable monster, a child-eating giant who keeps watch over a castle, and a dog who has lived more than one lifetime. Fairy Tale is the perfect blend of fantasy, coming-of-age, friendship, and magic--it's good versus evil, a boy and his dog on a perilous quest, it's Stephen King doing what he does best: giving us a story that sets our imagination on fire. --Seira Wilson, Amazon Editor<BR><BR>Review<BR>Praise for Fairy Tale<BR><BR>"Stephen King has all the daring, enchantment and even romance of a classic bedtime story, but King's signature unsettling style will keep you sitting up straight and wide-eyed rather than drifting off to dreamland." <BR>--Vanity Fair<BR><BR>"You'll be grateful that there are 600-plus pages of it to remind you several times over how much fun that kind of reading experience is... Good, evil, a kingdom to save, monsters to slay--these are the stuff that page-turners are made from."<BR>--Laura Miller, Slate<BR><BR>"A page-turner driven by memorably strange encounters and well-rendered, often thrilling action."<BR>--The New York Times Book Review <BR><BR>"An enthralling, adventurous read that will, like any genuine fairy tale, scare you half to death and lift up your heart... A splendid work of world-building."<BR>--Colette Bancroft, The Tampa Bay Tribune<BR><BR>"Once upon a time, Stephen King dared to write a novel called 'Fairy Tale' and totally lived up to that simple but lofty title... The book bursts with creativity... A profound story of good vs. evil that's timeless and timely... life-affirming... After turning that last page, you'll feel a little stronger in spirit, yearn for another story and, dare we say, maybe even live happily ever after."<BR>--Brian Truitt, USA Today<BR><BR>"Lovely... captures the creeping suspense of childhood classics."<BR>-- The Chicago Tribune<BR><BR>"If writing this beautiful, exciting, touching fairy tale did the trick for him, then imagine what it will do for you as a reader."<BR>--Emily Burnham, Bangor Daily News<BR><BR>"Ambitious, pure, and powerful... One of King's grandest narrative statements, and another must-read book from a master."<BR>--Matthew Jackson, Syfy Wire<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers. His recent work includes Fairy Tale, Billy Summers, If It Bleeds, The Institute, Elevation, The Outsider, Sleeping Beauties (cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy: End of Watch, Finders Keepers, and Mr. Mercedes (an Edgar Award winner for Best Novel and a television series streaming on Peacock).

CHAPTER ONE The Goddam Bridge. The Miracle. The Howling. <BR><BR>1 <BR>I'm sure I can tell this story. I'm also sure no one will believe it. That's fine with me. Telling it will be enough. My problem-and I'm sure many writers have it, not just newbies like me-is deciding where to start.<BR><BR>My first thought was with the shed, because that's where my adventures really began, but then I realized I would have to tell about Mr. Bowditch first, and how we became close. Only that never would have happened except for the miracle that happened to my father. A very ordinary miracle you could say, one that's happened to many thousands of men and women since 1935, but it seemed like a miracle to a kid.<BR><BR>Only that isn't the right place, either, because I don't think my father would have needed a miracle if it hadn't been for that goddamned bridge. So that's where I need to start, with the goddamned Sycamore Street Bridge. And now, thinking of those things, I see a clear thread leading up through the years to Mr. Bowditch and the padlocked shed behind his ramshackle old Victorian.<BR><BR>But a thread is easy to break. So not a thread but a chain. A strong one. And I was the kid with the shackle clamped around his wrist.<BR><BR>2 <BR>The Little Rumple River runs through the north end of Sentry's Rest (known to the locals as Sentry), and until the year 1996, the year I was born, it was spanned by a wooden bridge. That was the year the state inspectors from the Department of Highway Transportation looked it over and deemed it unsafe. People in our part of Sentry had known that since '82, my father said. The bridge was posted for ten thousand pounds, but townies with a fully loaded pickup truck mostly steered clear of it, opting for the turnpike extension, which was an annoying and time-consuming detour. My dad said you could feel the planks shiver and shake and rumble under you even in a car. It was dangerous, the state inspectors were right about that, but here's the irony: if the old wooden bridge had never been replaced by one made of steel, my mother might still be alive.<BR><BR>The Little Rumple really is little, and putting up the new bridge didn't take long. The wooden span was demolished and the new one was opened to traffic in April of 1997.<BR><BR>"The mayor cut a ribbon, Father Coughlin blessed the goddam thing, and that was that," my father said one night. He was pretty drunk at the time. "Wasn't much of a blessing for us, Charlie, was it?"<BR><BR>It was named the Frank Ellsworth Bridge, after a hometown hero who died in Vietnam, but the locals just called it the Sycamore Street Bridge. Sycamore Street was paved nice and smooth on both sides, but the bridge deck-one hundred and forty-two feet long-was steel grating that made a humming sound when cars went over it and a rumble when trucks used it-which they could do, because the bridge was now rated at sixty thousand pounds. Not big enough for a loaded semi, but long-haulers never used Sycamore Street, anyway.<BR><BR>There was talk every year in the town council about paving the deck and adding at least one sidewalk, but every year it seemed like there were other places where the money was needed more urgently. I don't think a sidewalk would have saved my mother, but paving might have. There's no way to know, is there?<BR><BR>That goddam bridge.<BR><BR>3 <BR>We lived halfway up the long length of Sycamore Street Hill, about a quarter of a mile from the bridge. There was a little gas-and-convenience store on the other side called Zip Mart. It sold all the usual stuff, from motor oil to Wonder Bread to Little Debbie cakes, but it also sold fried chicken made by the proprietor, Mr. Eliades (known to the neighborhood as Mr. Zippy). That chicken was exactly what the sign in the window said: THE BEST IN THE LAND. I can still remember how tasty it was, but I never ate a single piece after my mom died. I would have gagged it up if I tried.<BR><BR>One Saturday in November of 2003-the town council still discussing paving the bridge and still deciding it could wait another year-my mother told us she was going to walk down to the Zippy and get us fried chicken for dinner. My father and I were watching a college football game.<BR><BR>"You should take the car," Dad said. "It's going to rain."<BR><BR>"I need the exercise," Mom said, "but I'll wear my Little Red Riding Hood raincoat."<BR><BR>And that's what she was wearing the last time I saw her. The hood wasn't up because it wasn't raining yet, so her hair was spilling over her shoulders. I was seven years old, and thought my mother had the world's most beautiful red hair. She saw me looking at her through the window and waved. I waved back, then turned my attention to the TV, where LSU was driving. I wish I had looked longer, but I don't blame myself. You never know where the trapdoors are in your life, do you?<BR><BR>It wasn't my fault, and it wasn't Dad's fault, although I know he blamed himself, thought if only I'd gotten up off my dead ass and given her a ride to the damn store. It probably wasn't the fault of the man in the plumbing truck, either. The cops said he was sober, and he swore he was keeping to the speed limit, which was 25 in our residential zone. Dad said that even if that were true, the man must have taken his eyes off the road, if only for a few seconds. Dad was probably right about that. He was an insurance claims adjuster, and he told me once that the only pure accident he ever heard of was a man in Arizona who was killed when a meteor hit him in the head.<BR><BR>"There's always someone at fault," Dad said. "Which is not the same as blame."<BR><BR>"Do you blame the man who hit Mom?" I asked.<BR><BR>He thought about it. Raised his glass to his lips and drank. This was six or eight months after Mom died, and he'd pretty much given up on beer. By then he was strictly a Gilbey's man.<BR><BR>"I try not to. And mostly I can do that unless I wake up at two in the morning with nobody in the bed but me. Then I blame him."<BR><BR>4 <BR>Mom walked down the hill. There was a sign where the sidewalk ended. She walked past the sign and crossed the bridge. By then it was getting dark and starting to drizzle. She went into the store, and Irina Eliades (of course known as Mrs. Zippy) told her more chicken was coming out in three minutes, five at the most. Somewhere on Pine Street, not far from our house, the plumber had just finished his last job of that Saturday and was putting his toolbox in the back of his panel van.<BR><BR>The chicken came out, hot and crispy and golden. Mrs. Zippy boxed up an eight-piece and gave Mom an extra wing to eat on her walk home. Mom thanked her, paid, and stopped to look at the magazine rack. If she hadn't done that, she might have made it all the way across the bridge-who knows? The plumber's van must have been turning onto Sycamore Street and starting down the mile-long hill while Mom was checking out the latest issue of People.<BR><BR>She put it back, opened the door, and spoke to Mrs. Zippy over her shoulder: "Have a nice night." She might have cried out when she saw the van was going to hit her, and God knows what she might have been thinking, but those were the last words she ever spoke. She went out. The rain was coming down cold and steady by then, silvery lines in the glow of the one streetlight on the Zip Mart side of the bridge.<BR><BR>Munching on her chicken wing, my mother walked onto the steel deck. Headlights picked her out and threw her shadow long behind her. The plumber passed the sign on the other side, the one that reads BRIDGE SURFACE FREEZES BEFORE ROAD! PLEASE USE CAUTION! Was he looking in his rearview mirror? Maybe checking for messages on his phone? He said no to both, but when I think of what happened to her that night, I always think of my dad saying the only pure accident he ever heard of was the man who took a meteor to the head.<BR><BR>There was plenty of room; the steel bridge was quite a bit wider than the wooden version had been. The problem was that steel grating. He saw my mother halfway across the bridge and hit the brake, not because he was speeding (or so he said) but out of pure instinct. The steel surface had started to freeze. The panel truck skidded and slued, starting to come sideways. My mother shrank against the bridge rail, dropping her little piece of chicken. The panel truck slued further, struck her, and sent her spinning along the rail like a top. I don't want to think about the parts of her that were torn off in that death-spin, but I'm helpless not to sometimes. All I know is that the nose of the panel truck finally drove her into a bridge stanchion near the Zip Mart side of the bridge. Part of her went into the Little Rumple. Most of her stayed on the bridge.<BR><BR>I carry a picture of us in my wallet. I was maybe three when it was taken. She's got me on her hip. One of my hands is in her hair. She had beautiful hair.<BR><BR>5 <BR>Shitty Christmas that year. You better believe it.<BR><BR>I remember the reception after the funeral. It was at our house. My father was there, greeting people and accepting condolences, and then he was gone. I asked his brother, my Uncle Bob, where he was. "He had to lie down," Uncle Bob said. "He was really worn out, Charlie. Why don't you go outside and play?"<BR><BR>I had never felt less like playing in my life, but I went outside. I passed a bunch of grownups who had come outside to smoke and I heard one of them say poor guy, drunk as a skunk. Even then, deep in grief for my mother, I knew who they were talking about.<BR><BR>Before Mom died, my father was what I'd call "a regular drinker." I was just a little kid in the second grade, so I suppose you have to take that with a grain of salt, but I stand by it. I never heard him slurring, he didn't stumble around the place, he didn't go out to bars, and he never laid a hand on me or my mother. He would come home with his briefcase and Mom would give him a drink, usually a martini. She'd have one, too. In the evening, while we were watching TV, he might have a couple of beers. That was it.<BR><BR>All that changed after the goddam bridge. He was drunk after the funeral (as a skunk), drunk on Christmas, and drunk on New Year's Eve (which, I found out later, people like him call Amateur Night). In the weeks and months after we lost her, he was drunk most of the time. Mostly at home. He still didn't go out to bars at night ("Too many assholes like me," he said once), and he still never laid a hand on me, but the booze was out of control. I know that now; then I just accepted it. Kids do that. Dogs, too.<BR><BR>I found myself getting my own breakfast two mornings a week, then four, then almost all the time. I'd eat Alpha-Bits or Apple Jacks in the kitchen and hear him snoring in the bedroom-great big motorboat snores. Sometimes he forgot to shave before leaving for work. After dinner (more and more that was take-out), I'd hide his car keys. If he needed a fresh bottle, he could walk down to the Zippy and get one. Sometimes I worried about him meeting a car on the goddam bridge, but not too much. I was sure (pretty sure, at least) that both of my parents couldn't possibly get wiped out in the same place. My dad worked in insurance, and I knew what actuarial tables were: figuring the odds.<BR><BR>He was good at his job, my dad, and he skated along for over three years in spite of his boozing. Did he get warnings at work? I don't know, but probably. Was he pulled over for driving erratically, once the drinking started in the afternoon? If he was, maybe he was let off with a warning. Make that probably, because he knew all the cops in town. Dealing with cops was part of his job.<BR><BR>There was a rhythm to our lives during those three years. Maybe not a good rhythm, not the sort you'd want to dance to, but one I could count on. I'd get home from school around three. My father would roll in around five, with a few drinks already under his belt and on his breath (he didn't go out to the bars at night, but I found out later he was a regular at Duffy's Tavern on his way home from the office). He'd bring a pizza, or tacos, or Chinese from Joy Fun. Some nights he'd forget and we'd order out... or rather, I would. And after dinner the real drinking would start. Mostly gin. Other stuff if the gin was gone. Some nights he fell asleep in front of the TV. Some nights he'd stumble into the bedroom, leaving his shoes and rumpled suitcoat for me to put away. Once in awhile I'd wake up and hear him crying. It's pretty awful to hear that in the middle of the night.<BR><BR>The crash came in 2006. It was summer vacation. I had a Shrimp League game at ten in the morning-hit two home runs and made an awesome catch. I came home just after noon and found my father already there, sitting in his chair and staring at the TV, where old-time movie stars were having a duel on some castle stairs. He was in his undershorts and sipping a white drink that smelled to me like straight Gilbey's. I asked him what he was doing home.<BR><BR>Still looking at the swordfight and hardly slurring at all, he said: "I seem to have lost my job, Charlie. Or, if I can quote Bobcat Goldthwait, I know where it is, but someone else is doing it. Or soon will be."<BR><BR>I thought I didn't know what to say, but words came out of my mouth anyway. "Because of your drinking."<BR><BR>"I'm going to stop," he said.<BR><BR>I just pointed at the glass. Then I went into my bedroom and shut the door and started to cry.<BR><BR>He knocked on my door. "Can I come in?"<BR><BR>I didn't answer. I didn't want him to hear me blubbing.<BR><BR>"Come on, Charlie. I poured it down the sink."<BR><BR>Like I didn't know the rest of the bottle would be on the kitchen counter. And another one in the liquor cabinet. Or two. Or three.<BR><BR>"Come on, Charlie, what do you say?" Shay. I hated the slur in his voice.<BR><BR>"Fuck you, Dad."<BR><BR>I'd never said such a thing to him in my life, and I sort of wanted him to come in and give me a slap. Or a hug. Something, anyway. Instead I heard him shuffle into the kitchen, where the bottle of Gilbey's would be waiting.<BR><BR>He was asleep on the couch when I finally came out. The TV was still on, but muted. It was some other black-and-white movie, this one featuring old cars racing around what was obviously a movie set. Dad always watched TCM when he was drinking, unless I was home and insisted on something else. The bottle was on the coffee table, mostly empty. I poured what was left down the sink. I opened the liquor cabinet and thought about pouring away everything else, but looking at the gin, the whiskey, the vodka nips, the coffee brandy-that just made me tired. You wouldn't think a ten-year-old could be tired like that, but I was.<BR><BR>I put a Stouffer's frozen dinner in the microwave for supper-Grandma's Chicken Bake, our favorite-and shook him awake while it was cooking. He sat up, looked around like he didn't know where he was, then started to make these horrible chugging sounds I'd never heard before. He wove his way to the bathroom with his hands over his mouth and I heard him puking. It seemed to me like it would never stop, but eventually it did. The microwave binged. I got the Chicken Bake out, using the oven mitts that said GOOD COOKIN' on the left and GOOD EATIN' on the right-you forget to use those mitts once while you're taking something hot out of the zapper and you never forget again. I blopped some on our plates and then went into the living room, where Dad was sitting on the couch with his head down and his hands laced together on the back of his neck.<BR><BR>"Can you eat?"<BR><BR>He looked up. "Maybe. If you bring me a couple of aspirin."<BR><BR>The bathroom stank of gin and something else, maybe bean dip, but at least he'd gotten all of it in the bowl and flushed it away. I sprayed some Glade around, then brought him the aspirin bottle and a glass of water. He took three and put the glass where the bottle of Gilbey's had been. He looked up at me with an expression I'd never seen before, even after Mom died. I hate to say this, but I'm going to because it's what I thought then: it was the expression of a dog that has taken a shit on the floor.<BR><BR>"I could eat if you gave me a hug."<BR><BR>I hugged him and said I was sorry for what I said.<BR><BR>"It's okay. Probably I deserved it."<BR><BR>We went into the kitchen and ate as much of Grandma's Chicken Bake as we could manage, which wasn't very much. As he scraped our plates into the sink, he told me he was going to stop drinking, and that weekend he did. He told me that on Monday he was going to start looking for a job, but he didn't. He stayed home, watched old movies on TCM, and when I came home from baseball practice and noon swim at the Y, he was pretty much blotto.<BR><BR>He saw me looking at him and just shook his head. "Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I absolutely promise."<BR><BR>"I call bullshit," I said, and went into my room.<BR><BR>6 <BR>That was the worst summer of my childhood. Was it worse than after your mother died? you could ask, and I'd say yes, because he was the only parent I had left and because it all seemed to be happening in slow motion.<BR><BR>He did make a halfhearted effort at job hunting the insurance biz, but nothing came of it, even when he shaved and bathed and dressed for success. Word gets around, I guess.<BR><BR>The bills came in and piled up on the table in the front hall, unopened. By him, at least. I was the one who opened them when the stack got too high. I put them in front of him and he wrote checks to cover them. I didn't know when those checks would start to bounce back marked INSUFFICIENT FUNDS, and didn't want to know. It was like standing on a bridge and imagining an out-of-control truck was skidding toward you. Wondering what your last thoughts would be before it squashed you to death.<BR><BR>He got a part-time job at the Jiffy Car Wash out by the turnpike extension. That lasted a week, then he either quit or got fired. He didn't tell me which and I didn't ask.<BR><BR>I made the All-Star Shrimp League team, but we got knocked out in the first two games of a double-elimination tournament. During the regular season I'd hit sixteen home runs, I was Star Market's best power hitter, but in those two games I struck out seven times, once at a ball in the dirt and once sucking for a pitch so far over my head I would have needed an elevator to make contact. Coach asked what was wrong with me and I said nothing, nothing, just leave me alone. I was doing bad shit, too-some with a friend, some on my own.<BR><BR>And not sleeping very well. I wasn't having nightmares like I did after my mother died, I just couldn't get to sleep, sometimes not until midnight or one in the morning. I started turning my clock around so I wouldn't have to look at the numbers.<BR><BR>I didn't exactly hate my father (although I'm sure I would have come to in time), but I felt contempt for him. Weak, weak, I'd think, lying in bed and listening to him snore. And of course I'd wonder what was going to happen to us. The car was paid for, which was good, but the house wasn't and the size of those payments was horrifying to me. How long before he couldn't make the monthly nut? That time would surely come, because the mortgage had another nine years to run, and there was no way the money would hold out that long.<BR><BR>Homeless, I thought. The bank will take the house, like in The Grapes of Wrath, and we'll be homeless.<BR><BR>I had seen homeless people downtown, plenty of them, and when I couldn't sleep my mind turned to them. I thought about those urban wanderers a lot. Wearing old clothes that bagged on their skinny bods or stretched on their corpulent ones. Sneakers held together with duct tape. Crooked glasses. Long hair. Crazy eyes. Boozy breath. I thought about us sleeping in our car down by the old trainyards or in the Walmart parking lot among the RVs. I thought of my father pushing a shopping cart full of all we had left. I always saw my bedside alarm clock in that basket. I don't know why that horrified me, but it did.<BR><BR>Pretty soon I'd be going back to school, homeless or not. Some of the kids on my team would probably start calling me Strike-Out Charlie. Which would be better than Juicer's Kid Charlie, but how long before that got into the mix? People on our street already knew that George Reade didn't go to work anymore, and they almost certainly knew why. I didn't kid myself about that.<BR><BR>We were never a churchgoing family, or religious at all in any conventional sense. Once I asked my mom why we didn't go to church-was it because she didn't believe in God? She told me that she did, but she didn't need a minister (or a priest, or a rabbi) to tell her how to believe in Him. She said she only needed to open her eyes and look around to do that. Dad said he was brought up a Baptist but quit going when his church got more interested in politics than the Sermon on the Mount.<BR><BR>But one night about a week before school was scheduled to start again, it came into my mind to pray. The urge was so strong it was really a compulsion. I got down on my knees beside my bed, folded my hands, squeezed my eyes shut, and prayed that my father would quit drinking. "If you do that for me, whoever you are, I'll do something for you," I said. "Promise and hope to die if I don't keep it. You just show me what you want and I'll do it. I swear."<BR><BR>Then I got back into bed, and that night, at least, I slept through until morning.<BR><BR>7 <BR>Before he was fired, Dad worked for Overland National Insurance. It's a big company. You've probably seen their ads, the ones with Bill and Jill, the talking camels. Very funny stuff. Dad used to say, "All the insurance companies use ha-ha ads to get eyeballs, but the laughing stops once the insured files a claim. That's where I come in. I'm a claims adjuster, which means-nobody says it out loud-that I'm supposed to knock the contractual amount down. Sometimes I do, but here's a secret-I always start out on the claimant's side. Unless I find reasons not to be, that is."<BR><BR>Overland's Midwest headquarters is on the outskirts of Chicago, in what Dad called Insurance Alley. In his commuting days it was just a forty-minute drive from Sentry, an hour if the traffic was heavy. There were at least a hundred claims adjusters working out of that one office, and on a day in September of '08 one of the agents he used to work with came to see him. Lindsey Franklin was his name. Dad called him Lindy. It was in the late afternoon, and I was at the kitchen table, doing my homework.<BR><BR>That day had gotten off to a memorably shitty start. The house still smelled faintly of smoke even though I'd sprayed around the Glade. Dad had decided to make omelets for breakfast. God knows why he was up at six AM, or why he decided I needed an omelet, but he wandered away to use the bathroom or turn on the TV and forgot about what was on the stove. Still half-loaded from the night before, no doubt. I woke up to the bray of the smoke detector, ran into the kitchen in my underwear, and found smoke billowing up in a cloud. The thing in the frypan looked like a charred log.<BR><BR>I scraped it down the garbage disposer and ate Apple Jacks. Dad was still wearing an apron, which looked stupid. He tried to apologize and I mumbled something just to get him to shut up. What I remember about those weeks and months is that he was always trying to apologize and it drove me bugfuck.<BR><BR>But it was also a memorably good day, one of the best days, because of what happened that afternoon. You're probably way ahead of me on this, but I'll tell you anyway, because I never stopped loving my dad, even when I didn't like him, and this part of the story makes me happy.<BR><BR>Lindy Franklin worked for Overland. He was also a recovering alcoholic. He wasn't one of the claims agents who was particularly close to my father, probably because Lindy never stopped at Duffy's Tavern after work with the other guys. But he knew why my dad had lost his job, and he decided to do something about it. To give it a try, at least. He made what I later learned is called a Twelfth Step visit. He had a bunch of claims appointments in our town, and once he finished with those, he decided on the spur of the moment to stop by our place. He later said he almost changed his mind because he didn't have backup (recovering alcoholics usually make Twelfth Step visits with a partner, sort of like Mormons), but then he said what the hell and looked up our address on his phone. I don't like to think what might have happened to us if he'd decided not to. I never would have been inside Mr. Bowditch's shed, that's for sure.<BR><BR>Mr. Franklin was wearing a suit and tie. He had a sharp haircut. Dad-unshaven, shirt untucked, barefoot-introduced us. Mr. Franklin shook my hand, said it was very nice to meet me, then asked if I minded going outside so he could speak to my father alone. I went willingly enough, but the windows were still open from the breakfast disaster and I heard quite a bit of what Mr. Franklin said. I remember two things especially. Dad said the drinking was because he still missed Janey so much. And Mr. Franklin said, "If booze would bring her back, I'd say fine. But it won't, and how would she feel if she saw how you and your boy are living now?"<BR><BR>The other thing he said was, "Aren't you sick and tired of being sick and tired?" That was when my father started to cry. Usually I hated it when he did that (weak, weak), but I thought maybe this crying was different.<BR><BR>8 <BR>You knew all that was coming, and probably you know the rest of the story as well. I'm sure you do if you're in recovery yourself or know someone who is. Lindy Franklin took Dad to an AA meeting that night. When they got back, Mr. Franklin called his wife and said he was staying over with a friend. He slept on our pull-out couch and the next morning he took Dad to a seven AM meeting called Sober Sunrise. That became Dad's regular meeting and it was where he got his first-year AA medallion. I skipped school so I could give it to him, and that time I was the one who did some blubbing. No one seemed to mind; there's a lot of blubbing at those meetings. Dad gave me a hug afterward, and so did Lindy. By then I was calling him by his first name, because he was around a lot. He was my dad's sponsor in the program.<BR><BR>That was the miracle. I know a lot about AA now, and know it happens to men and women all over the world, but it still seemed like a miracle to me. Dad didn't get his first medallion exactly a year after Lindy's Twelfth Step call, because he had a couple of slips, but he owned up to them and the AA people said what they always say, keep coming back, and he did, and the last slip-a single beer from a sixpack he poured down the sink-was just before Halloween of 2009. When Lindy spoke at Dad's first anniversary, he said that lots of people get offered the program but never get the program. He said Dad was one of the lucky ones. Maybe that was true, maybe my prayer was just a coincidence, but I chose to believe it wasn't. In AA, you can choose to believe what you want. It's in what recovering alkies call the Big Book.<BR><BR>And I had a promise to keep.<BR><BR>9 <BR>The only meetings I went to were Dad's anniversary meetings, but as I say, Lindy was around a lot and I picked up most of the slogans AA people are always spouting. I liked you can't turn a pickle back into a cucumber, and God don't make junk, but the one that stuck with me-and does to this day-is something I heard Lindy tell Dad one night when Dad was talking about all the unpaid bills and how he was afraid of losing the house. Lindy said my father getting sober was a miracle. Then he added, "But miracles ain't magic."<BR><BR>Six months after sobering up, Dad reapplied at Overland, and with Lindy Franklin and some others backing him up-including his old boss, the one who pink-slipped him-he got his job back, but he was on probation and knew it. That made him work twice as hard. Then, in the fall of 2011 (two years sober), he had a discussion with Lindy that lasted so long that Lindy ended up sleeping on the pull-out couch again. Dad said he wanted to go independent, but he wouldn't do it without Lindy's blessing. After making sure that Dad wouldn't start drinking again if his new business failed-as sure as he could be, anyway; recovery ain't rocket science, either-Lindy told him to go ahead and take a shot.<BR><BR>Dad sat me down and explained what that meant: working without a net. "So what do you think?"<BR><BR>"I think you should say adios to those talking camels," I told him, and that made him laugh. Then I said what I had to. "But if you start drinking again, you'll screw it up."<BR><BR>Two weeks later he gave Overland his notice, and in February of 2012 he hung out his shingle in a tiny office on Main Street: George Reade Investigator and Independent Claims Adjuster.<BR><BR>He didn't spend much time in that hole-in-the-wall; mostly he was out pounding the pavement. He talked to cops, he talked to bail bondsmen ("Always good for leads," he said), but mostly he talked to lawyers. A lot of them knew him from his work at Overland, and knew he was on the square. They gave him jobs-the tough ones, where the big companies were either drastically reducing the amount they were willing to pay or denying the claim altogether. He worked long, long hours. Most nights I came home to an empty house and cooked my own dinner. I didn't mind. At first when my dad finally did come in, I hugged him so I could surreptitiously smell his breath for the unforgettable aroma of Gilbey's Gin. After awhile, though, I just hugged him. And he rarely missed a Sober Sunrise meeting.<BR><BR>Sometimes Lindy would come to lunch on Sundays, usually bringing take-out, and the three of us would watch the Bears on TV, or the White Sox if it was baseball season. On one of those afternoons, my father said business was picking up every month. "It would go faster if I got on the claimant's side more often in slip-and-fall cases, but so many of them smell bad."<BR><BR>"Tell me about it," Lindy said. "You could make short-term gains, but in the end that work would bite you on the ass."<BR><BR>Just before the start of my junior year at Hillview High, Dad said we had to have a serious talk. I braced myself for a lecture about underage drinking, or a discussion about some of the crap I and my friend Bertie Bird had gotten up to during (and-for awhile-after) his drinking years, but neither of those were what he had in mind. It was school he wanted to talk about. He told me I had to do well if I wanted to get into a good college. Really well.<BR><BR>"My business is going to work. It was scary at first, there was that time when I had to reach out to my brother for a loan, but that's almost paid back and I think I'll be on solid ground before long. The phone rings a lot. When it comes to college, though..." He shook his head. "I don't think I'm going to be able to help you much, at least to start with. We're damn lucky to be solvent at all. Which is my fault. I'm doing everything I can to remedy the situation-"<BR><BR>"I know."<BR><BR>"-but you need to help yourself. You need to work. You need to score high on the SATs when you take them."<BR><BR>I planned to take the Scholastic Aptitude in December, but didn't say so. Dad was on a roll.<BR><BR>"You also need to think about loans, but only as a last resort-those loans'll haunt you for a long time. Think scholarships. And play your sports, that's also a road to scholarships, but mostly it's grades. Grades, grades, grades. I don't need to see you graduate valedictorian, but I need to see you in the top ten. Understand?"<BR><BR>"Yes, Father," I said, and he gave me a playful swat.<BR><BR>10 <BR>I studied hard and made my grades. I played football in the fall and baseball in the spring. I made varsity in both sports as a sophomore. Coach Harkness wanted me to play basketball as well, but I told him no. I said I needed at least three months a year to do other things. Coach went away shaking his head at the sad state of youth in this degenerate age.<BR><BR>I went to some dances. I kissed some girls. I made some good friends, most of them jocks but not all. I discovered some metal bands I liked and played them loud. My dad never protested, but he got me EarPods for Christmas. There were terrible things in my future-I'll tell you about them eventually-but none of the terrible things I had lain awake imagining ever came to pass. It was still our house and my key still unlocked the front door. That was good. If you've ever imagined you might wind up spending cold winter nights in a car or a homeless shelter, you know what I'm talking about.<BR><BR>And I never forgot the deal I made with God. If you do that for me, I'll do something for you, I'd said. On my knees I said it. You just show me what you want and I'll do it. I swear. It had been a child's prayer, so much magical thinking, but part of me (most of me) didn't believe that. Doesn't now. I thought my prayer had been answered, just like in one of those corny Lifetime movies they show between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Which meant I had my end of the bargain to hold up. I felt that if I didn't, God would take back the miracle and my dad would start drinking again. You have to keep in mind that high school kids-no matter how big the boys, no matter how beautiful the girls-are still mostly children inside.<BR><BR>I tried. In spite of days not just crammed with school and after-school activities but bulging with them, I did my best to pay back what I owed.<BR><BR>I joined a Key Club Adopt-A-Highway commitment. We got two miles of Highway 226, which is basically a wasteland of fast food joints, motels, and gas stations. I must have picked up a bazillion Big Mac boxes, two bazillion beer cans, and at least a dozen pairs of castoff undies. One Halloween I put on a stupid orange jumper and went around collecting for UNICEF. In the summer of 2012, I sat at a voter registration table downtown, although I was still a year and a half from being old enough to vote myself. I also helped out at my dad's office on Fridays after practice, filing papers and doing computer input stuff-your basic scutwork-as it grew dark outside and we ate pizza from Giovanni's straight out of the box.<BR><BR>Dad said all that stuff would look great on my college apps, and I agreed without telling him that wasn't why I was doing it. I didn't want God deciding I wasn't holding up my end, but sometimes I thought I could hear a heavenly whisper of disapproval: Not good enough, Charlie. Do you really think picking up roadside trash is payback for the good life you and your father are living now?<BR><BR>Which brings me-finally-to April of 2013, the year I was seventeen. And Mr. Bowditch.<BR><BR>11 <BR>Good old Hillview High! Seems like a long time ago to me now. In the winter I rode the bus, sitting at the back with Andy Chen, a friend of mine since elementary. Andy was a jock who went on to play basketball for Hofstra. Bertie was gone by then, moved away. Which was kind of a relief. There is such a thing as a good friend who is also a bad friend. In truth, Bertie and I were bad for each other.<BR><BR>In the fall and spring, I rode my bike because we live in a hilly town and biking was a good way to build up muscle strength in my legs and backside. It also gave me time to think and be alone, which I liked. Heading home from HHS it was Plain Street to Goff Avenue, then Willow Street to Pine. Pine Street intersected with Sycamore at the top of the hill that led down to the goddam bridge. And on the corner of Pine and Sycamore was the Psycho House, so named by Bertie Bird when we were only ten or eleven.<BR><BR>It was actually the Bowditch house, the name was right on the mailbox, faded but still legible, if you squinted. Still, Bertie had a point. We had all seen that movie (along with such other required eleven-year-old viewing as The Exorcist and The Thing), and it did look sort of like the house where Norman Bates lived with his stuffed mother. It wasn't like any of the other neat little duplexes and ranchers on Sycamore and in the rest of our neighborhood. The Psycho House was a rambling slump-roofed Victorian, once probably white but now faded to a shade I'd call Feral Barncat Gray. There was an ancient picket fence running the length of the property, leaning forward in places and sagging back in others. A rusty waist-high gate barred the broken paving of the walk. The grass was mostly weeds that had run rampant. The porch looked like it was slowly coming detached from the house to which it belonged. All the shades were drawn, which Andy Chen said was pointless, since the windows were too dirty to see through, anyway. Half-buried in the tall grass was a NO TRESPASSING sign. On the gate was a bigger sign reading BEWARE OF DOG.<BR><BR>Andy had a story about that dog, a German Shepherd named Radar, like the guy in the M*A*S*H TV show. We'd all heard him (not knowing this Radar was actually a her), and had gotten the occasional glimpse, but Andy was the only one who'd seen the dog up close. He said he stopped on his bike one day because Mr. Bowditch's mailbox was open and stuffed so full of junk mail that some of it had fallen to the sidewalk and was blowing around.<BR><BR>"I picked up the litter and crammed it back in with the rest of the crap," Andy said. "I was just trying to do him a favor, for crying out loud. Then I hear this growling and a barking that was like YABBA-YABBA-ROW-ROW, and I look up and here comes this fucking monster dog, must have weighed a hundred and twenty pounds at least, and he's all teeth with slobber flying back and his eyes are fucking red."<BR><BR>"Sure," Bertie said. "Monster dog. Like Cujo in that movie. Riii-ight."<BR><BR>"It was," Andy said. "Swear to God. If it hadn't been for the old guy yelling at him, he would have gone right through that gate. Which is so old it needs Medicure."<BR><BR>"Medicare," I said.<BR><BR>"Whatever, dude. But the old guy came out on the porch and he yells, 'Radar, down!' and the dog dropped right down on its belly. Only it never stopped looking at me and it never stopped growling. Then the guy goes, he goes 'What are you doing there, boy? Are you stealing my mail?' So I go 'No sir, it was blowing around and I was picking it up. Your mailbox is awful full, sir.' And he goes, then he goes 'I'll worry about my mailbox, you just get out of here.' Which I did." Andy shook his head. "That dog would have torn my throat out. I know it."<BR><BR>I was sure Andy was exaggerating, he had a habit of doing that, but I asked Dad about Mr. Bowditch that night. Dad said he didn't know much about him, just that he was a lifelong bachelor who'd been living in that wreck of a house for longer than Dad had been living on Sycamore Street, which was going on twenty-five years.<BR><BR>"Your friend Andy isn't the only kid he's yelled at," Dad said. "Bowditch is famous for his foul temper and his equally foul-tempered German Shepherd. The town council would love for him to die so they can tear that place down, but so far he's hanging in there. I speak to him when I see him-which is rarely-and he seems civil enough, but I'm an adult. Some elderly guys have an allergy to kids. Steer clear of him would be my advice, Charlie."<BR><BR>Which was no problem until that day in April of '13. Which I will now tell you about.<BR><BR>12 <BR>I stopped at the corner of Pine and Sycamore on my way home from baseball practice to unpeel my left hand from the handlebars of my bike and give it a shake. It was still red and throbbing from that afternoon's drills in the gym (the field was still too muddy to be playable). Coach Harkness-who coached baseball as well as hoops-had me on first while a number of guys trying out for pitcher practiced pickoff throws. Some of those guys threw really hard. I won't say Coach was getting back at me for refusing to play basketball-where the Hedgehogs had gone 5-20 the previous season-but I won't say he wasn't, either.<BR><BR>Mr. Bowditch's slumped and rambling old Victorian was on my right, and from that angle it looked more like the Psycho House than ever. I was wrapping my hand around the left grip of my bike, ready to get going again, when I heard a dog let out a howl. It came from behind the house. I thought of the monster dog Andy had described, all big teeth and red eyes above its slavering jaws, but this was no YABBA-YABBA-ROW-ROW of a vicious attack animal; it sounded sad and scared. Maybe even desolate. I have thought back on that, wondering if it's only hindsight, and have decided it wasn't. Because it came again. And a third time, but low and kind of unwinding, as if the animal making it was thinking what's the use.<BR><BR>Then, much lower than that last unwinding howl: "Help."<BR><BR>If not for those howls, I would have coasted down the hill to my house and had a glass of milk and half a box of Pepperidge Farm Milanos, happy as a clam. Which could have been bad for Mr. Bowditch. It was getting late, the shadows drawing long toward evening, and that was a damn cold April. Mr. Bowditch could have lain there all night.<BR><BR>I got the credit for saving him-another gold star for my college applications, should I throw modesty to the winds as my father suggested and attach the newspaper article that was published a week later-but it wasn't me, not really.<BR><BR>It was Radar that saved him, with those desolate howls.<BR><BR></div

An instant New York Times bestseller!<BR><BR>From theÂ bestselling author of But What if We're Wrong, a wise and funny reckoning with the decade that gave us slacker/grunge irony about the sin of trying too hard, during the greatest shift in human consciousness of any decade in American history.<BR><BR>It was long ago, but not as long as it seems: The Berlin Wall fell and theÂ Twin Towers collapsed. In between, one presidential election was allegedly decided by Ross Perot while another was plausibly decided by Ralph Nader. In the beginning, almost every name and address was listed in a phone book, and everyone answered their landlines because you didn't know who it was. By the end, exposing someone's address was an act of emotional violence, and nobody picked up their new cell phone if they didn't know who it was. The 90s brought about a revolution in the human condition we're still groping to understand. Happily, Chuck Klosterman is more than up to the job.<BR><BR>Beyond epiphenomena like "Cop Killer" and Titanic and Zima, there Â were wholesale shifts in how society was perceived: the rise of the internet, pre-9/11 politics, and the paradoxical belief that nothing was more humiliating than trying too hard. Pop culture accelerated without the aid of a machine that remembered everything, generating an odd comfort in never being certain about anything. On a 90's Thursday night, more people watched any random episode of Seinfeld than the finale of Game of Thrones. But nobody thought that was important; if you missed it, you simply missed it.Â It was the last era that held to the idea of a true, hegemonic mainstream before it all began to fracture, whether you found a home in it or defined yourself against it. <BR>Â <BR>In The Nineties, Chuck Klosterman makes a home in all of it: the film, the music, the sports, the TV, the politics, the changes regarding race and class and sexuality, the yin/yang of Oprah and Alan Greenspan. In perhaps no other book ever written would a sentence like, "The video for 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' was not more consequential than the reunification of Germany" make complete sense. Chuck Klosterman has written a multi-dimensionalÂ masterpiece, a work of synthesis so smart and delightful that future historians might well refer to this entire period as Klostermanian.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"In The Nineties, Klosterman examines the social, political and cultural history of the era with his signature wit. It's a fascinating trip down memory lane." --Time<BR><BR>"An engaging, nuanced and literate take on the alternately dynamic and diffident decade." --Washington Post<BR><BR>"Serving up the moments and meanings of a modern decade in a few hundred pages is no easy task, but Chuck Klosterman has managed to boil a hearty stew of insight. . . . [Klosterman is] a master of smooth setups and downbeat finishes." --USA Today<BR><BR>"[Klosterman is] Generation X's definitive chronicler of culture." --GQ<BR><BR>"From one of our great chroniclers of pop culture comes this entertaining romp through the twilight years of the twentieth century. . . . Roving across flashpoints in movies, music, and politics, Klosterman captures a world where apathy was the defining tone, art was experiencing a seismic shift, and celebrity culture was on the eve of a digital explosion." --Esquire <BR><BR>"Simultaneously a deep and light sprint through the decade that doesn't just namecheck people and bands and movies, but burrows under as to why they were important then. And what that means today. . . . Klosterman zips in and around the entirety of the decade, and even readers who were up on pop culture at the time will be reminded of things they haven't thought about in two or more decades. . . . If you came of age in the '90s, you will love The Nineties. If not, it's a singularly wonderful analytical and historical book of a time not so long ago." --Houston Press<BR><BR>"Leave it to Chuck Klosterman to examine the decade in a fresh, unpredictable way that avoids nostalgia and easy generalizations. . . . Klosterman's text is never anything less than wise, challenging and winningly idiosyncratic." --Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<BR><BR>"An informative, endlessly entertaining look back at the 1990s. . . . What [Klosterman] always succeeds at is conveying an anecdote, oddity, or thought exercise about the decade that you immediately want to share with a friend." --BuzzFeed<BR><BR>"Always an astute cultural observer and a fan of deep dives into any subject, Klosterman is focused here on a decade in American life that he says is often portrayed as 'a low-risk grunge cartoon' . . . Klosterman's gift is seizing on those moments that any Gen Xer can readily recall and pulling the strings a bit to put it in some kind of historical perspective." --Associated Press<BR><BR>"Klosterman's remarkable book made me rethink my decade and rethink myself." --Airmail<BR>Â <BR>"The nineties continue to fascinate, especially with a wonderful guide like Chuck Klosterman." --Toronto Star<BR><BR>"A book that you'll read in about two days, but then want to re-read to make sure you didn't miss anything." --Fatherly<BR><BR>"[The Nineties] attempts a comprehensive analysis of the texture of the 1990s--'the feeling of the era.' Perhaps no cultural critic is better suited for this task than Klosterman. . . . By immersing himself in the objectivity furnished by the past, Klosterman opens a critical space wherein we can consider the present." --SPIN<BR><BR>"Klosterman zooms in on the interplay between the titular decade's opposing generations--Generation X and Baby Boomers--and puts the era's technological transformations in their rightful historical contexts. . . . His greatest service here is his resistance to assign sharp edges where there is only an underwhelming, fuzzy consensus." --Vulture, "49 Books We Can't Wait to Read in 2022"<BR><BR>"Klosterman is far too ambitious to merely let readers wallow in nostalgia and instead looks at the '90s by applying the accessible style of cultural criticism that has been his brand during a career that has now spanned 12 books. The Nineties examines everything from pop culture (Ross and Rachel) to politics (Ross Perot and Ralph Nader), as well as the Information Age's age of innocence when the internet was looming out there somewhere, waiting to happen and transform society." --San Francisco Chronicle<BR><BR>"[T]he 1990s is about the arrival of new media technologies that would upend our lives in endless ways large and small. . . . Klosterman's take on all of this often is insightful, prompting the reader to think about what the internet and social media have done to our brains, to our sense of selves, to our physical environments. . . . [A]n entertaining tour. Klosterman skillfully analyzes Gen-X touchstones like Quentin Tarantino and 'Seinfeld,' Nirvana and Garth Brooks." --The Oregonian<BR><BR>"Wonderfully researched, compellingly written, and often very funny, this is a superb reassessment of an underappreciated decade from a stupendously gifted essayist." --Booklist (starred review)<BR><BR>"An entertaining journey through the last decade of the 20thÂ century. . . . [Klosterman] brings the decade to vivid new life. . . . As in his previous books of cultural criticism, Klosterman delivers a multifaceted portrait that's both fun and insightful. A fascinating examination of a period still remembered by most, refreshingly free of unnecessary mythmaking." --Kirkus (starred review)<BR><BR>"There's not much missing from this delightful collection of quotes and culture from the era that most find difficult to define. . . . With humor and history (supported by articles, TV news segments, advertisements, and interviews), Klosterman's volume is the perfect guide for millennials who wear vintage t-shirts ironically. From politics to Prozac, a fascinating exploration of Generation X from the perspective of those who lived it and witnessed it. Readers will be raiding closets for mom jeans and drawers for scrunchies after reading this nostalgia-inducing book." --Library Journal (starred review)<BR><BR>"The Nineties Is a fun and funny romp through a decade just now distant enough to be viewed in historical relief. Chuck Klosterman is old enough to have grown up in the old order of culture and politics that began to tremble, and eventually collapse, during the 1990s; he's young enough to be immersed fully in the new societal currents that began in those years and define us now. For all the delight Klosterman takes in his narrative excursions, his sketches of the Bill Clinton years evoke melancholy. For a moment, it seemed plausible that a young new president could play usher to a post-Cold War era of humane and rational politics. For now, at least, we must recall the 1990s as the soil in which our contemporary politics of contempt, paranoia, alienation, and violence blossomed." --John Harris, founding editor, Politico<BR><BR>"The Nineties is a fascinating, wholly original exploration of a bewilderingly bygone time, written by one of our wisest, wryest cultural critics. Who else could pull Quentin Tarantino, college football, and Alan Greenspan--not to mention Tiger Woods, Dick Morris, and Reality Bites--into a coherent examination of a world about to undergo a paradigm shift?" --Louisa Thomas, staff writer, The New Yorker<BR><BR>"This might be the book Chuck Klosterman was born to write: a witty and unpredictable history of the decade that just won't go away. From OJ to AOL to the GOP, he has a theory about everything, and a story aboutÂ how all of it fits together." --Kelefa Sanneh, author of Major Labels<BR><BR>"Chuck Klosterman has done something remarkable and, to be honest, frightening. He's hacked his way through the great clutter of our information age, where we know everything but understand nothing, to arrive at a magical oasis of reckoning and recognition, to discover a fact that's been hiding in plain sight, the only fact that matters anymore, really, namely this: the 1990s were the last decade of the United States of America, as a functioning cohesive society and as an idea. Buy this book right now, not because of the smart history it unspools, although that's a delight, but because of the window it gives you into the future." --Wright Thompson, author of Pappyland<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Chuck Klosterman is the bestselling author of eight nonfiction books (including The Nineties; Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs; and But What If We're Wrong?), two novels (Downtown Owl and The Visible Man), and the short story collection Raised in Captivity. He has written for The New York Times, The Washington Post, GQ, Esquire, Spin, The Guardian (London), The Believer, and ESPN. Klosterman served as the Ethicist for The New York Times Magazine for three years and was an original founder of the website Grantland with Bill Simmons. He was raised in rural North Dakota and now lives in Portland, Oregon.<BR><BR>Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission.

Decades are about cultural perception, and culture can't read a clock. The 1950s started in the 1940s. The sixties began when John Kennedy demanded we go to the moon in '62 and ended with the shootings at Kent State in May of 1970. The seventies were conceived the morning after Altamont in 1969 and expired during the opening credits of American Gigolo, which means there were five months when the sixties and the seventies were happening at the same time. It felt like the eighties might live forever when the Berlin Wall fell in November of '89, but that was actually the onset of the euthanasia (though it took another two years for the patient to die).<BR><BR>When writing about recent history, the inclination is to claim whatever we think about the past is secretly backward. "Most Americans regard the Seventies as an eminently forgettable decade," historian Bruce J. Schulman writes in his book The Seventies. "This impression could hardly be more wrong." In the opening sentence of The Fifties, journalist David Halberstam notes how the 1950s are inevitably recalled as a series of black-and-white photographs, in contrast to how the sixties were captured as moving images in living color. This, he argued, perpetuates the illusionary memory of the fifties being "slower, almost languid." There's always a disconnect betweenÂ the world we seem to remember and the world that actually was. What's complicated about the 1990s is that the central illusion is memory itself.<BR><BR>The boilerplate portrait of the American nineties makes the whole era look like a low-risk grunge cartoon. That portrait is imperfect. It is not, however, wildly incorrect. The decade was heavily mediated and assertively self-conscious, but not skewed and misshapen by the internet and social media. Its trajectory can be traced with accuracy. Almost every meaningful moment of the nineties was captured on videotape, along with thousands upon thousands of trivial moments that meant nothing at all. The record is relatively complete. But that deluge of data remained, at the time, ephemeral and unavailable. It was still a present-tense existence. For much of the decade, Seinfeld was the most popular, most transformative live-action show on television. It altered the language and shifted comedic sensibilities, and almost every random episode was witnessed by more people than the 2019 finale of Game of Thrones. Yet if you missed an episode of Seinfeld, you simply missed it. You had to wait until it was re-aired the following summer, when you could try to manually record it on VHS videotape. If you missed it again, the only option was to go to a public archive in Los Angeles or Manhattan and request a special viewing on eight-millimeter videotape. But of course, this limitation was not something people worried about, because caring that much about any TV show was not a normal thing to do. And even if you did, you would pretend you did not, because this was the nineties. You would be more likely to claim that you didn't own a television.<BR><BR>That, more than any person or event, informed the experience of nineties life: an adversarial relationship with the unseemliness of trying too hard. Every generation melodramatically assumes it will somehow be the last, and there was some of that in the nineties, too--but not as much as in the decade that came before and far less than in the decades that would come after. It was perhaps the last period in American history when personal and political engagement was still viewed as optional. Many of the polarizing issues that dominate contemporary discourse were already in play, butÂ ensconced as thought experiments in academic circles. It was, in retrospect, a remarkably easy time to be alive. There were still nuclear weapons, but there was not going to be a nuclear war. The internet was coming, but reluctantly, and there was no reason to believe it would be anything but awesome. The United States experienced a prolonged period of economic growth without the protracted complications of a hot or cold war, making it possible to focus on one's own subsistence as if the rest of society were barely there. Concerns and anxieties were omnipresent, but the stakes were vague: Teenagers were allegedly obsessed with angst, and the explanation as to why was pondered constantly without any sufficient answer. It didn't even seem like those asking the question particularly cared what the explanation was, or at least not until twelve kids were massacred by their classmates at a Colorado high school in 1999. But by then it was too late, and the question seemed less important than the problem, and the problem had just become what was now considered normal.<BR><BR>It's impossible to claim that all people living through a period of history incontrovertibly share any qualities across the board. It's also difficult to dissect a decade that was still operating as a monoculture without habitually dwelling on the details of dominance (when I write "it was a remarkably easy time to be alive," I only refer to those for whom it was, and for whom it usually is). Nothing can ever be everything to everyone. But it's hard to exaggerate the pervasion of self-constructed, self-aware apathy that would come to delineate the caricature of a time period that already feels forgotten, mostly because those who embodied it would feel embarrassed to insist it was important. The fashions of the 1980s did not gradually fade. The fashions of the 1980s collapsed, and--almost immediately--the zeitgeist they'd elevated appeared garish and gross. There was a longing for the 1970s, but not in the way people of the seventies had longed for the fifties. It was not nostalgia for a time that was more wholesome. It was nostalgia for a time when you could relax and care less. In the nineties, doing nothing on purpose was a valid option, and a specific brand of cool became more important thanÂ almost anything else. The key to that coolness was disinterest in conventional success. The nineties were not an age for the aspirant. The worst thing you could be was a sellout, and not because selling out involved money. Selling out meant you needed to be popular, and any explicit desire for approval was enough to prove you were terrible.<BR><BR>The paradox is that the indoctrination of these attitudes had little impact on how the decade actually unspooled. The nineties ethos was deeply internalized but sporadically applied. The number of midlevel celebrities increased, as did the public appetite for personality-driven news. Unemployment peaked in '92 but decreased thereafter. The economy boomed, much more than it had during the wealth-obsessed administration of Ronald Reagan. Banking deregulations untethered the financial superstructure from frugal orthodoxy, most notably the 1999 repeal of legislation separating commercial banking from investment banking. Income disparity enlarged. Many of the goals now associated with the eighties did not really come into fruition until the nineties. Despite an overabundance of historical information, the collective memory of the decade tends to be simplified and minimized, dictated more by the texture of the time than by anything that transpired.<BR><BR>And yet: The texture is what mattered. The feeling of the era, and what that feeling supposedly signified, isolates the nineties from both its distant past and its immediate future. It was a period of ambivalence, defined by an overwhelming assumption that life, and particularly American life, was underwhelming. That was the thinking at the time.<BR><BR>It is not the thinking now.<BR><BR>Now the 1990s seem like a period when the world was starting to go crazy, but not so crazy that it was unmanageable or irreparable. It was the end of the twentieth century, but also the end to an age when we controlled technology more than technology controlled us. People played by the old rules, despite a growing recognition that those rules were flawed. It was a good time that happened long ago, although not nearly as long ago as it seems. </div

Limiting its scope and depth of topics to those that readers can actually utilize, this book covers first the fundamentals, then follows with logic, counting, relations and digraphs, functions, order relations and structures, trees, graph theory, semigroups and groups, languages and finite-state machines, and groups and coding. With its comprehensive appendices and index, this book can be an excellent reference work for mathematicians and those in the field of computer science.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR><BR>Discrete mathematics is an interesting course to teach and to study at the freshman and sophomore level for several reasons. Its content is mathematics, but most of its applications and more than half its students are from computer science. Thus careful motivation of topics and previews of applications are important and necessary strategies. Moreover, there are a number of substantive and diverse topics covered in the course, so a text must proceed clearly and carefully, emphasizing key ideas with suitable pedagogy. In addition, the student is often expected to develop an important new skill: the ability to write a mathematical proof. This skill is excellent training for writing good computer programs. <BR><BR>This text can be used by students in mathematics as an introduction to the fundamental ideas of discrete mathematics, and a foundation for the development of more advanced mathematical concepts. If used in this way, the topics dealing with specific computer science applications can be ignored or selected independently as important examples. The text can also be used in a computer science or computer engineering curriculum to present the foundations of many basic computer-related concepts and provide a coherent development and common theme for these ideas. The instructor can easily develop a suitable course by referring to the chapter prerequisites which identify material needed by that chapter. <BR><BR>Approach<BR>First, we have limited both the areas covered and the depth of coverage to what we deem prudent in a first course taught at the freshman and sophomore level. We have identified a set of topics that we feel are of genuine use in computer science and elsewhere and that can be presented in a logically coherent fashion. We have presented an introduction to these topics along with an indication of how they can be pursued in greater depth. This approach makes our text an excellent reference for upper-division courses. <BR><BR>Second, the material has been organized and interrelated to minimize the mass of definitions and the abstraction of some of the theory. Relations and digraphs are treated as two aspects of the same fundamental mathematical idea, with a directed graph being a pictorial representation of a relation. This fundamental idea is then used as the basis of virtually all the concepts introduced in the book, including functions, partial orders, graphs, and mathematical structures.

This includes sets, subsets, and their operations; sequences; properties of the integers, including base n representations; matrices; and mathematical structures. A goal of this chapter is to help students develop skills in identifying patterns on many levels. Chapter 2 covers logic and related material, including methods of proof and mathematical induction. Although the discussion of proof is based on this chapter, the commentary on proofs continues throughout the book. Chapter 3, on counting, deals with permutations, combinations, the pigeonhole principle, elements of probability, and recurrence relations. <BR><BR>Chapter 4 presents basic types and properties of relations, along with their representation as directed graphs. Connections with matrices and other data structures are also explored in this chapter. Chapter 5 deals with the notion of a function and gives important examples of functions, including functions of special interest in computer science. An introduction to the growth of functions is developed. Chapter 6 covers partially ordered sets, including lattices and Boolean algebras. A symbolic version for finding a Boolean function for a Boolean expression joins the pictorial Kamaugh method. Chapter 7 introduces directed and undirected trees along with applications of these ideas. Elementary graph theory with applications to transport networks and matching problems is the focus of Chapter 8. <BR><BR>In Chapter 9 we return to mathematical structures and present the basic ideas of semigroups, groups, rings, and fields. By building on work in previous chapters, only a few new concepts are needed. Chapter 10 is devoted to finite-state machines. It complements and makes effective use of ideas developed in previous chapters. Chapter 11 finishes our discussion of coding for error detecting and correction and for security purposes. Appendix A discusses algorithms and pseudocode. The simplified pseudocode presented here is used in some text examples and exercises; these may be omitted without loss of continuity. Appendix B gives some additional experiments dealing with extensions or previews of topics in various parts of the course. </div<BR><BR>Approach<BR>First, we have limited both the areas covered and the depth of coverage to what we deem prudent in a first course taught at the freshman and sophomore level. We have identified a set of topics that we feel are of genuine use in computer science and elsewhere and that can be presented in a logically coherent fashion. We have presented an introduction to these topics along with an indication of how they can be pursued in greater depth. This approach makes our text an excellent reference for upper-division courses. <BR><BR>Second, the material has been organized and interrelated to minimize the mass of definitions and the abstraction of some of the theory. Relations and digraphs are treated as two aspects of the same fundamental mathematical idea, with a directed graph being a pictorial representation of a relation. This fundamental idea is then used as the basis of virtually all the concepts introduced in the book, including functions, partial orders, graphs, and mathematical structures. Whenever possible, each new idea introduced in the text uses previously encountered material and, in turn, is developed in such a way that it simplifies the more complex ideas that follow. <BR><BR>What Is New in the Fifth Edition<BR>We continue to believe that this book works well in the classroom because of the unifying role played by the two key concepts: relations and digraphs.

One of the architects of the U.S. space program recalls his most exciting moments at mission control as he guided heroes like Alan Shepard and John Glenn on their historic missions.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>On July 20, 1969, near the end of a great decade of near-space exploration, a small craft called Eagle landed on the moon's surface. As anyone who watched the televised broadcast of the landing might recall, the astronauts aboard Eagle were guided to their objective by a capable ground crew headed by Chris Kraft, whom his colleagues had long called "Flight." Kraft was unflappable on the surface, but, as he writes in this memoir, the Eagle's landing had moments of drama that gave him pause, and that few outside NASA knew about--including baleful alarms from the ship's on-board computer that warned of imminent disaster.<BR><BR>For Kraft, frightening moments were part of his job as director of Mission Control. He encountered many of them in the early years of the space program, when failures were commonplace and all too often caused not by mechanics but by politics. We learn of many in Kraft's pages. One such failure was the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch, about which Kraft thunders, "We should have beaten them.... We were stopped by anonymous doctors in the civilian world who didn't know what they were talking about, by a bureaucrat in the White House who'd been stung when JFK shot down his position on manned space flight, and by our friend the German rocket scientist, who got cold feet when he should have been bold."<BR><BR>Plenty of other contemporaries, including John Glenn and Richard Nixon, come in for a scolding in Kraft's fiery account, which offers a rare insider's portrait of the challenging work of astronautics--work that, Kraft writes hopefully, is only beginning. --Gregory McNamee <BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>Besides the astronauts, Kraft was one of NASA's best-known personalities in the agency's heroic decade of the 1960s, once making the cover of Time. The blunt-speaking demeanor that made Kraft popular with the press is fully present in his memoir, in which he lets fly about various instances of his dissatisfaction with the performance of an astronaut, engineer, or contractor. Such dirty-laundry airing, verboten at the time by the publicity-conscious NASA, is one reason for space-history buffs to flock to Kraft's narrative, but the principal attraction is how he ramped up from scratch the flight control operation for Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. When Sputnik beeped the U.S. into a panic, Kraft was an engineer at the obscure National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), quickly revamped as NASA. Tapped by the unsung organizer of manned flight, Robert Gilruth, to establish what became Mission Control, Kraft directed the early flights, whose participants he critiques by his lights as a no-nonsense engineer. His key role and frankness of recollection make Kraft a worthy memoirist of pioneering space flight. Gilbert Taylor<BR>Copyright © American Library Association.

Gene Kranz was present at the creation of America's manned space program and was a key player in it for three decades. As a flight director in NASA's Mission Control, Kranz witnessed firsthand the making of history. He participated in the space program from the early days of the Mercury program to the last Apollo mission, and beyond. He endured the disastrous first years when rockets blew up and the United States seemed to fall further behind the Soviet Union in the space race. He helped to launch Alan Shepard and John Glenn, then assumed the flight director's role in the Gemini program, which he guided to fruition. With his teammates, he accepted the challenge to carry out President John F. Kennedy's commitment to land a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. <BR>Kranz was flight director for both Apollo 11, the mission in which Neil Armstrong fulfilled President Kennedy's pledge, and Apollo 13. He headed the Tiger Team that had to figure out how to bring the three Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to Earth. (In the film Apollo 13, Kranz was played by the actor Ed Harris, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance.) <BR>In Failure Is Not an Option, Gene Kranz recounts these thrilling historic events and offers new information about the famous flights. What appeared as nearly flawless missions to the Moon were, in fact, a series of hair-raising near misses. When the space technology failed, as it sometimes did, the controllers' only recourse was to rely on their skills and those of their teammates. Kranz takes us inside Mission Control and introduces us to some of the whiz kids -- still in their twenties, only a few years out of college -- who had to figure it all out as they went along, creating a great and daring enterprise. He reveals behind-the-scenes details to demonstrate the leadership, discipline, trust, and teamwork that made the space program a success. <BR>Finally, Kranz reflects on what has happened to the space program and offers his own bold suggestions about what we ought to be doing in space now. <BR>This is a fascinating firsthand account written by a veteran mission controller of one of America's greatest achievements. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>In 1957, the Russians launched Sputnik and the ensuing space race. Three years later, Gene Kranz left his aircraft testing job to join NASA and champion the American cause. What he found was an embryonic department run by whiz kids (such as himself), sharp engineers and technicians who had to create the Mercury mission rules and procedure from the ground up. As he says, "Since there were no books written on the actual methodology of space flight, we had to write them as we went along."<BR><BR>Kranz was part of the mission control team that, in January 1961, launched a chimpanzee into space and successfully retrieved him, and made Alan Shepard the first American in space in May 1961. Just two months later they launched Gus Grissom for a space orbit, John Glenn orbited Earth three times in February 1962, and in May of 1963 Gordon Cooper completed the final Project Mercury launch with 22 Earth orbits. And through them all, and the many Apollo missions that followed, Gene Kranz was one of the integral inside men--one of those who bore the responsibility for the Apollo 1 tragedy, and the leader of the "tiger team" that saved the Apollo 13 astronauts.<BR><BR>Moviegoers know Gene Kranz through Ed Harris's Oscar-nominated portrayal of him in Apollo 13, but Kranz provides a more detailed insider's perspective in his book Failure Is Not an Option. You see NASA through his eyes, from its primitive days when he first joined up, through the 1993 shuttle mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, his last mission control project. His memoir, however, is not high literature. Kranz has many accomplishments and honors to his credit, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but this is his first book, and he's not a polished author. There are, perhaps, more behind-the-scenes details and more paragraphs devoted to what Cape Canaveral looked like than the general public demands. If, however, you have a long-standing fascination with aeronautics, if you watched Apollo 13 and wanted more, Failure Is Not an Option will fill the bill. --Stephanie Gold

How much of ourselves do we disclose when we speak or write? A person's accent may reveal, for example, whether they hail from Australia, or Ireland, or Mississippi. But it's not just where we were born--we divulge all sorts of information about ourselves and our identity through language. Level of education, gender, age, and even aspects of our personality can all be reliably determined by our vocabulary and grammar. To those who know what to look for, we give ourselves away every time we open our mouths or tap on a keyboard.<BR><BR>But how unique is a person's linguistic identity? Can language be used to identify a specific person? To identify--or to exonerate--a murder suspect? To determine who authored a particular book? The answer to all these questions is yes. Forensic and computational linguists have developed methods that allow linguistic fingerprinting to be used in law enforcement. Similar techniques are used by literary scholars to identify the authors of anonymous or contested works of literature. Many people have heard that linguistic analysis helped to catch the Unabomber, or to unmask an anonymous editorialist--but how is it done? LINGUSISTIC FINGERPRINTS will explain how these methods were developed and how they are used to solve forensic and literary mysteries. But these techniques aren't perfect, and the book will also include some cautionary tales about mistaken linguistic identity.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Roger Kreuz is an Associate Dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of Memphis and a Professor in the University's Psychology Department. He works mainly in experimental psychology, cognitive psychology, and psychology of language. He earned his Ph.D at Princeton University. In addition to two edited books, and over fifty journal articles and book chapters, He has been an author on about a hundred research presentations at national and international conferences. According to Google Scholar, his publications have been cited more than 5,000 times.

"An extraordinary book."<BR>---Arthur C. Clarke<BR><BR>Space was one of the most fiercely fought battlegrounds of the Cold War, the Moon its ultimate beachhead.<BR><BR>In this dual autobiography, Apollo 15 commander David Scott and cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, the first man to ever walk in space, recount their exceptional lives and careers spent on the cutting edge of science and space explorationâand their participation in the greatest technological race everâto land a man on the Moon.<BR><BR>With each mission fraught with perilous tasks, and each space program touched by tragedy, these parallel tales of adventure and heroism read like a modern-day thriller. Cutting fast between their differing recollections, this book reveals, in a very personal way, the drama of one of the most ambitious contests ever embarked on by man, set against the conflict that once held the world in suspense: the clash between Communism and Western democracy. <BR><BR>Through the men's memoirs, their courage, passion for exploration, and determination to push themselves to the limit, emerge not only through their triumphs but also through their perseverance in times of extraordinary difficulty and danger.<BR><BR>"Two Sides of the Moon is unique among space histories. If you are looking for a balanced, interesting, and personal account of the American and Soviet space programs during the 1960s and 1970s this is it."<BR>---Astronomy magazine <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"A very valuable account of the way the Cold War was ended in Space." âSir Arthur C. Clarke, author of 2001: A Space Odyssey

Written like a California noir thriller by way of William Gibson, The Watchman brings to life the wildest, most audacious crime spree in the history of cyberspace. Busted as a teenager for hacking into Pac Bell phone networks, Kevin Poulsen would find his punishment was a job with a Silicon Valley defense contractor. By day he seemed to have gone straight, toiling on systems for computer-aided war. But by night he burglarized telephone switching offices, adopting the personae and aliases of his favorite comic-book anti heroes - the Watchmen. When authorities found a locker crammed with swiped telecommunications equipment, Poulsen became a fugitive from the FBI, living the life of a cyberpunk in a neon Hollywood underground. Soon he made the front pages of the New York Times and became the first hacker charged with espionage. Littman takes us behind the headlines and into the world of Poulsen and his rogues' gallery of cyberthieves. Drawing on hundreds of hours of interviews with Poulsen, his confederates, and the authorities, he spins a thrilling chase story on the electronic frontier. The nation's phone network was Poulsen's playground. On Los Angeles's lucrative radio giveaways, Poulsen worked his magic, winning Porsches and tens of thousands of dollars. He secretly switched on the numbers of defunct Yellow Pages escort ads and took his cut of the profits. And he could wiretap or electronically stalk whomever he pleased, his childhood love or movie stars. The FBI seemed no match for Poulsen. But as Unsolved Mysteries prepared a broadcast on the hacker's crimes, LAPD vice stumbled onto his trail, and an undercover operation began on Sunset Strip.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>This is a first-rate detective story--and all true. It's the story of a seemingly invincible electronic thief, con man, and stalker--and the people who tracked him down. Jonathan Littman brings his readers straight into the world of cyberpunk crime as he shows the origins, development, and climax of the wildest and most audacious known crime spree in cyberspace. Hundreds of hours of interviews allow Littman to tell much of the story through the eyes of those who lived it, and his own edgy style and excellent pacing make for a thriller that's hard to put down.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Littman (The Fugitive Game: Online with Kevin Mitnick, LJ 1/96) takes us inside the mind of yet another notable computer hacker. Kevin Poulsen electronically seized the phone lines of a major Los Angeles radio station to make certain he was the 101st caller. Over time, he won two Porsches, $22,000 in cash, and two trips to Hawaii. He was caught and charged with numerous computer and telephone crimes, the most serious of which alleged that he obtained a classified document from a military database. Poulsen became the first computer hacker in history to be charged with espionage, and in all he was charged with 19 counts of computer fraud, wiretapping, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. Littman offers a perspective on the social phenomenon of hacking in addition to the intricate legal and privacy issues involved here. Relying on interviews with both hackers and pursuers, pages of court filings, court transcripts, and associated documents, the author blends narrative with action in this riveting account of digital malfeasance. Recommended.?Joe Accardi, Northeastern Illinois Univ. Lib., Chicago<BR>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>More blatantly criminal than Kevin Mitnick, a cyber-outlaw whose downfall was told in Takedown by Tsutomu Shimomura , was a Californian hacker named Kevin Poulsen. A habitual burglar, purveyor of prostitution, and fixer of radio-station giveaways, he should probably consider the five-year jail term he finished in 1996 as light punishment. But not likely: Poulsen emerged from the early generation of antiauthoritarian hackers called "phone phreaks," who electronically broke into the local phone company's computers. Poulsen's compulsion went further: he physically broke into switching buildings to steal equipment that enabled him to break into the hush-hush realm of telephone taps. Littman, in "hundreds of hours" of jailhouse interviews, certainly squeezes a lot of juice out of Poulsen and serves it up as exciting true-crime fare, filled with aliases, FBI agents, stakeouts, and car chases--and with Poulsen's amoral attitude that nothing he was doing was wrong. A fast-paced yarn that re-creates the demimonde of computer criminals. Gilbert Taylor<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>Having chronicled the digital-data brigandage of the notorious Kevin Mitnick (The Fugitive Game, 1996), Littman casts a cool, discerning eye on Kevin Poulsen, who led law-enforcement agencies in a merry chase along the Information Highway. Drawing on extensive interviews with 31-year-old Poulsen, his partners in crime, and the cops who chased them down, the author offers an absorbing, evenhanded portrait of the hacker as a dangerous young man. A technical virtuoso before he was out of his teens and in trouble with authorities early on, the disaffected young Californian (whose on-line alias, The Watchman, was taken from the antihero of a dark-side comic series) also held responsible programming jobs at both SRI and Sun Microsystems before his Pacific Tel break-ins and other computer felonies made him officially unemployed. Going outlaw on a full-time basis, Poulsen trespassed on the memory banks of machines linked by modem on the Internet, exposed the security weaknesses of government and university installations, played embarrassing pranks on rivals, and otherwise showcased his considerable talents for electronic wizardry. He rigged a contest run by an L.A. radio station (by diverting its phone lines) and collected a couple of Porsches as prizes. He also managed to ferret out wiretaps Big Brother's helpers (FBI, Secret Service, et al.) had planted on the ACLU, foreign consulates, suspected mobsters, and others. Despite his professed allegiance to a hacker code, Poulsen was not fastidious about profiting from his skills, putting them at the disposal of call-girl rings and shady private detectives. Eventually brought to book in 1990 on a wealth of charges, the chronic offender was allowed to cop a plea in the interests of protecting the feds' dirtier secrets. An arresting account of the career of a New Age intruder whose capacity to strike at will mocks the very notion of computer privacy and security. (photos, not seen) -- Copyright ®1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.<BR><BR>Review<BR>Jonathan Littman's account of Kevin Poulsen . . . reads like a cat-and-mouse-with-keyboards thriller. The Watchman is a guided tour through the subculture of "phreaks"--hackers obsessed with tapping into the telephone company. Mr. Littman does a good job of translating acronym-laden geekspeak into English, and his use of present-tense narrative gives one the feeling of looking over the shoulder as he hacks and hatches his schemes. -- The New York Times Book Review, J.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>This updated and revised edition of the American Book Award-winner and national bestseller revitalizes the truth of America's history, explores how myths continue to be perpetrated, and includes a new chapter on 9/11 and the Iraq War.<BR><BR>Americans have lost touch with their history, and in Lies My Teacher Told Me Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past.<BR><BR>In this revised edition, packed with updated material, Loewen explores how historical myths continue to be perpetuated in today's climate and adds an eye-opening chapter on the lies surrounding 9/11 and the Iraq War. From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring the vitality and relevance it truly possesses. <BR><BR>Thought provoking, nonpartisan, and often shocking, Loewen unveils the real America in this iconoclastic classic beloved by high school teachers, history buffs, and enlightened citizens across the country.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>James W.

"A deeply curious and evenhanded report on our national appetites." --The New York Times<BR><BR>In the tradition of Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemma, an extraordinary investigation into the human lives at the heart of the American grocery store<BR><BR>The miracle of the supermarket has never been more apparent. Like the doctors and nurses who care for the sick, suddenly the men and women who stock our shelves and operate our warehouses are understood as 'essential' workers, providing a quality of life we all too easily take for granted. But the sad truth is that the grocery industry has been failing these workers for decades. <BR><BR>In this page-turning expose, author Benjamin Lorr pulls back the curtain on the highly secretive grocery industry. Combining deep sourcing, immersive reporting, and sharp, often laugh-out-loud prose, Lorr leads a wild investigation, asking what does it take to run a supermarket? How does our food get on the shelves? And who suffers for our increasing demands for convenience and efficiency? In this journey:<BR><BR>â¢ We learn the secrets of Trader Joe's success from Trader Joe himself<BR>â¢ Drive with truckers caught in a job they call "sharecropping on wheels"<BR>â¢ Break into industrial farms with activists to learn what it takes for a product to earn certification labels like "fair trade" and "free range"<BR>â¢ Follow entrepreneurs as they fight for shelf space, learning essential tips, tricks, and traps for any new food business<BR>â¢ Journey with migrants to examine shocking forced labor practices through their eyes<BR><BR>The product of five years of research and hundreds of interviews across every level of the business, The Secret Life of Groceries is essential reading for those who want to understand our food system--delivering powerful social commentary on the inherently American quest for more and compassionate insight into the lives that provide it.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"An intense, immersive, humorous, and sometimes shocking portrait of the modern American supermarket."Â <BR>--NPR Shots<BR><BR>"The Secret Life of Groceries reveals the unsustainable reality of American shopping...no reader of this ambitious book will enter a store the same."<BR>--San Francisco Chronicle<BR><BR>"The Secret Life of Groceries is a deeply curious and evenhanded report on our national appetites."<BR>--The New York Times<BR><BR>"The Secret Life of Groceries takes us on a tour through the lives that the food system touches so that we have clear eyes about the human and environmental cost of our demands. If we can stomach it."<BR>--The Washington Post<BR><BR>"Is "literary muck-raking" a genre?Â  It is now.Â  This book is at once a satisfying, enjoyable meal and a glass of cold water to the face.Â  The modern shopper wants groceries that are ethical, sustainable, humane, affordable, fresh, and convenient.Â  But as Lorr discovers, the costs of our demands are recouped from the bottom of the food chain:Â debt-ruined truckers, foreign slave labor, and Whole Foods workers in our own communities -- the people whose lives Lorr shared (and sometimes lived) for weeks or months.Â  Does it sound grim?Â  It's not!Â Â The Secret Life of GroceriesÂ is a terrificÂ read.Â  The stories flow, and the hard truths are seasoned with wit and hope.Â  Bottle this man and get him into every home!"<BR>--Mary Roach, author of Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers<BR>Â <BR>"A titanic achievement of reportage, insight, humor, and humanity,The Secret Life of Groceries will forever change the way you think about the American food system.

With compassion and humor, Lorr introduces us to very real people who constitute that abstraction we call the "supply chain" and challenges us, in a thoughtful and nuanced way, to consider the high price we pay for supermarket bargains."<BR>--Timothy Noah, author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It<BR><BR>"This fascinating, deep dive into the American supermarket changed how I thought about grocery stores. Both entertaining and enraging, Benjamin Lorr offers a compassionate indictment of the way we feed ourselves."Â <BR>--Tracie McMillan, author of The American Way of Eating: Undercover at Walmart, Applebee's, Farm Fields and the Dinner Table<BR><BR>"With prodigious research and vivid writing, Benjamin Lorr follows our food through a bizarre culture of enslaved fishermen, inventive entrepreneurs, underpaid truckers, exploited store workers, and chains so corrupt that bribes are routinely labeled 'fees.' Don't read this book if you want to remain complacent about your groceries. If you want to be informed, as you should, this book is a must." <BR>--David K. Shipler, former New York Times correspondent and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of seven books, includingÂ The Working Poor: Invisible in America <BR><BR>"A brain-bending look at how and why these massive stores filled with every type of food are even possible...

If you didn't think it was possible for a book about groceries to have richness, insight, humor, humanity, and charm all at once, read The Secret Life of Groceries.

All rights reserved.<BR><BR>INTRODUCTION<BR><BR>Let's look beneath the ice-chipped surface of a fish counter at a Whole Foods in New York City. This happens every other month after closing. The customers leave, the checkout crew changes into street clothes, the store goes into lockdown to prevent its own employees from robbing them. Shifts change and the ceaseless shitty Hall & Oates music stops and is replaced by silence. Night workers, a motley rainbow of low English, low skill, low smile workers, come in, kneepads over long pants, to restock the shelves like a reverse midnight harvest. They stoop over, heads down, in their KIND bar tm shirts, or whatever other functional and empowering edible shelled out sponsorship money, kneeling there, glumly stacking yogurts. At the fish counter, the seafood team begins. Fish are removed, latex gloves gripping them two at time--fillets and whole fish, sloppy little bastards-- and tossed into the plastic tubs that are their nightly home. The mussels are bagged, the shrimp scooped together into mesh cages. Next the metal trays come up. These are little more than decorative housing, and are promptly sprayed down to remove a day's worth of sweat and oil and torn pieces of flesh that sloughed off from handling. Below the trays, a thin plastic webbing for grip, then a layer of ice: once individual chips, now grown hard as a skating rink from periodic thaws and re- icings during the day. The surface is littered with the typical debris: fish parts, crumpled-up stickers announcing wild caught!, errant cockles, cracked mussels.<BR>Â <BR>Usually that would be it. Aprons would be stripped off, giant foul garbage bags of fish guts and butcher paper would be lugged to the dumpsters in the back. But on this night, the one that comes every other month or so, the case itself is cleaned. An order has come down from high, seemingly at random. And so, for the entire length of the 38- foot case, the employees hack the ice into large chunks. It is exactly like shoveling snow in the winter and they use big thick shovels to do the job. Standing up on metal platforms to get leverage, they chop straight down, chiseling out 2' x 2' x 2' blocks that they then systematically take out like giant sugar cubes to be melted in the back. It is reasonably physical work and soon they are sweating. Once the top layer is removed, they begin anew on the layer below: gridding it out, chiseling, pulling out cubes. Beneath this second layer, the ice is more crunchy, less frozen. It's an old freezer and inconsistent and it only takes a few scrapes before you get to streaks of brown. A few more and the smell comes. It is horrible and not at all of decomposition but of fecal waste maybe sweetened slightly, thick in the air like you are exhuming something dangerous, which perhaps you are. Soon after the smell, the streaks of brown darken and the ice turns with entrails and smashed pieces of shell, the shovel uncovering squid tentacles, crab antennae, all two months old, rotten, buried under there, each scrape revealing some new purple color, and the odor is such that you really cannot breathe it long. So neither team member does, instead spelling each other by rushing off to do other tasks like melting the giant cubes under hot water or just standing to the side and muttering how the fuck does it get like this?<BR>Â <BR>Then, at a certain scrape of the shovel, the bottom of the case is revealed. Stainless steel. But it's streaked green with bile, gray with pancreatic froth, pink with clam flesh, all strung out and mashed in the ice slurry. To the extent that they are recognizable, the contents are inexplicable and vaguely horrifying. No shrimp were stored in this section of the case, so why the rotting pile of shrimp casings? No whole fish either, so why the set of red lacy gills? Months of slow melting and cracks in the ice and the chaos of retail have allowed it all to accumulate down there in a weird gutter of seafood waste compressed beneath four and a half feet of ice.<BR>Â <BR>Eventually the ice and slime are removed and a high-blast hose with a separate nozzle for green concentrated soap is sprayed against the stainless- steel bottom. The water so there is steam, your glasses fog up, and the rot slithers down drain. The shells cluster in cracked bits and are removed by hand. Finally, now somewhere closer to one a.m., the case bottom clean, even gleaming, and the team goes back to the giant machine along the north wall to return with heaping shovels of virginal white snow. Clean ice, the cleanest you've ever seen after and they pile it in heaps into the case, building back the buffer between the wet semi- rot that will be the bottom of the case and a top retail surface downy and clean. When they are finished, the ice sparkles. No more skate rink, each chip separate and glittering in the light; the perfect platform to sell good fish. The smell, once choking, is not just muffled but nonexistent. A very real and solid barrier has been erected. And once the floor has been sprayed down and mopped across with a giant squeegee, the entire scene will feel like a dream. Tomorrow morning the fish will be laid down again in their metal trays, cut parsley and trills of red peppers arranged on top. And it won't be unhygienic in the least. It will be undetectable and irrelevant. There will be a thick wall of ice separating the retail surface from the depths below. And in this way--the very real way the fish case at Whole Foods on the Bowery can be simultaneously appalling and perfectly hygienic and safe--it is a fitting metaphor for the grocery business as whole.<BR>Â <BR>Â <BR>***<BR>Â <BR>This book is about the grocery store. About the people who work there and the routes of supply that define it. It is the product of five years of research, hundreds of interviews, and thousands of hours tracking down and working alongside the buyers, brokers, marketers, and managers whose lives and choices define our diet. The five years were a time of dramatic upheaval. Walmart seized organics. Amazon seized Whole Foods. The promise of automation loomed over trucking. Minimum wage laws shifted, giving employees the promise of a new salary floor. Yet, what I found, whether talking to Whole Foods executives about the Amazon deal or to new Amazon employees as they stocked shelves, was that during this upheaval the most primal drives in the industry weren't so much disrupted as elevated and laid bare.<BR>Â <BR>What emerged is a fascinating and largely hidden world. In 2018, Americans spent $701 billion at supermarket- style grocery stores, still our largest food expenditure by a wide there are 38,000 of these stores across this land, and the average adult will spend 2 percent of their life inside one. They are the interface most familiar and least understood in our food system: bland to the point of invisibility, so routine they blur into background. And yet the grocery store exists as one of the only places where our daily decisions impact--make us complicit in--a system have come in equal parts to scorn and see as savior. We've been happy to let more impersonal aspects of our food system--from industrialized slaughterhouses to farm bill subsidies--take up the share of investigation and critique. But to understand how and why our food gets to us in the form it does, the grocery store is a powerful entry point. It is not only the way that most of us are introduced to the system, tagging along with Mom as she shops, it is perhaps the best opportunity to understand the system on the terms of the people who operate it on our behalf.<BR>Â <BR>Â <BR>***<BR>Â <BR>In the retail store, the deboned bulk chilled chicken breasts, or Granny Smith apples, or long fillets of frozen salmon, or whatever other food you want to imagine--arrive in their cardboard boxes, vacu-sealed in a marvel of plastic packaging, and when you click your box cutter down and reach to take them out, they cease being food. Another transformation has occurred; they are product now. Merchandise. SKUs. Listen to the retail managers and assistant managers talk among themselves: the word "food" doesn't come up; it is an irrelevant, unhelpful, even illogical way to discuss the work of a grocery. To these men it is always product. And so, an item within the grocery matrix loses its identity as food and becomes product. It is liberated; its transformation is no less critical to the project of civilization. Now it is defined by the cubic inches of its packaging, its price per unit, and the velocity of its sales. It is not until much later, the moment the customer comes pushing their cart down the aisle and reaches out for that Styrofoam tray, that our chicken becomes food again. It is a tenuous thing, but suddenly it has a new owner and a new meaning; now it will be eaten, and everything that matters about it has changed to reflect that fact.<BR>Â <BR>And when you start digging into precisely how the people in grocery think, you find one thing open and waiting in the center: the maw. That voracious, devouring hole we feed three to thirty times a day, swallowing and salivating and stuffing, ceaseless in its demands right up to the point we lie in a hospital bed and it gets temporarily assisted by a polyurethane tube. The maw to me, like the sun above interfacing with the chloroplasts below the leaf, is more than just a mouth: it is a secular revelation, a complex of destruction and creativity, anchored in need. It is the sensory cells of the gut. The neuronal charge to acquire. The curiosities, comforts, and cravings we convince ourselves are necessities. It--like the Vedic concept of Self/ self--comes in the universal as well as the personal, each of our unique pie holes mere tributaries to some more tremendous vortex right at the heart of the human project. And it is this maw more than anything that animates the wonks in the grocery back room, poring over their spreadsheets, deciding how to stock our shelves. More than greed, health, altruism, grocery wants to serve. The fact that we make serving that need so complicated, the fact that it ends in the contradiction that is the Whole Foods fish counter, beautiful and vile at the same time, should not be an invitation to scorn the system--or ourselves-- but an opportunity for introspection and perhaps even growth. And ultimately it should upend our perception of grocery to remember it isn't about food, it never has about food-- food is the business of eating-- grocery, we'll see, completely different; it's the business of desire.<BR><BR></div

From the Introduction: This pretty much is what the title says. Many of the stories/novellas here will have only been done in limited print runs, such as in fanzines, magazines, pamphlets, special editions or online magazines. It's a mixed genre of stories and these are what Brian considers the best of the rest of the stories in his body of work. We've got 111,000+ words in this collection so that means lots of enjoyment in what is likely the last collection coming from Brian. "The Challenge" As some fools do. But do you dare? Yes? Well, don't! "The Man Who Photographed Beardsley" They should have been pictures from life - or was he simply impatient? "The Cyprus Shell" There are some you can eat, while others have their own pick-me-ups. "Clean Slate" If you're in debt to the Devil, don't mess with look-a-like sisters. "The Deep-Sea Conch" Some species build nests; while others are much like the cuckoo.... "The Ugly Act" But what's a pimple or two - if there's only you? "Irving's Story" Her downstairs knew best, every time. "The Running Man" It may be true you can run - but as for finding a place to hide...? "Somebody Calling" The only way she could. He simply had to listen harder. "Vanessa's Voice" Both beautiful ... and deadly! "The Vehicle" Some might think of him that way, others as a dyadic personality? "Mandraki" Take care who you lie down with ... and where! "Two Stone Tom" Yes, except he was an entire science heavier than that! "The Long Last Night" Was it just a myth - or a Mythos? "The Weird Wines of Naxas Niss" A wizard's stolen potion is another man's gateway to Nirvana...maybe! "Stealer of Dreams" Always remember, once they're gone they might stay gone!

Harry Keogh, the Necroscope, the man who can talk to the dead, and Earth's greatest vampire hunter, has been searching for his wife and infant son, gone missing during Harry's war against the vampires. This obsession has left him open to subtle influence by an ancient vampire, Radu.

Under a heavy blanket of lowering snow clouds and in the shadow of the hills the time made little or no difference: everything looked grey ... except that which now lay exposed, with the snow shovelled back from it, under the canopy of a scenes-of-crime canvas rigged up by the local police. That--what was left of it--was not grey but red. Very red. And torn ..."Animal," said old Angus McGowan, giving a curt, knowing nod. "A creature did it, an' a big yin at that!""Aye, that's what we thought," Inspector Ianson returned the old man's nod. "A beast for sure. That's why we called you in, Angus. But now the big question: what sort of a beast? And how a beast ... I mean, up here in the snow and all?""Eh?" Angus McGowan looked at the Police Inspector curiously, even scathingly. "Up here in the snow and a'? Why ... where else, man?"Ianson shrugged, and shivered, but not entirely from the cold. "Where else?" He frowned as he pondered his old friend and rival's meaning, then shrugged again. "Just about anywhere else, I should think! The African veldt, maybe? The Australian outback? India? But Scotland? What, and Auld Windy, Edinburgh herself, little more than seven or eight miles away? No lions or tigers or bears up here, Angus--not unless they escaped from a zoo! Which is the other reason I called you in on it, as well you know."Angus glanced at him through rheumy, watering eyes. The cold--and, just as the Inspector himself had felt it, maybe something other than the cold--had seeped through to the old vet's bones. But then, the sight of bloody, violent, unnatural death will have a similar effect on most men.Inspector Ianson was tall, well over six feet, and thin as a pole. But for all that he was getting on a bit in years, George Ianson remained spry and alert,mentally and physically active. Homicide was his job (he might often be heard complaining, in his dry, emotionless brogue, "Man, how I hate mah work! It's sheer murrrder!"), and this was his beat, his area of responsibility: a roughly kite-shaped region falling between Edinburgh and Glasgow east to west, Stirling and Dumfries north to south. Outside that kite a man could get himself killed however he might or might not choose, and his body never have to suffer the cold, calculating gaze of George Ianson. But inside it ..."Africa? India?" Angus echoed the gangling Inspector, then squinted at the tossed and tangled corpse before shaking his head in denial. "No, no, George. She was no big cat, this yin. Nor a dog ... but like a dog, aye!"It was Ianson's turn to study the other: dour old Angus McGowan, whom he'd known for years. A living caricature! Typically a "canny old Scotsman," hugging his knowledge as close to his chest as a gambler with his cards, or a rich man with his wealth. His rheumy grey eyes--the eyes of a hawk for all that they were misted--missed nothing; his blue-veined nose seemed sensitive as a bloodhound's; his knowledge (he'd been a recognized authority in zoology for all of thirty years) brimmed in the library of his brain like an encyclopaedia of feral lore. Quite simply, as the Inspector was gifted to know men--their ways and minds and, in his case especially, their criminal minds--so Angus was gifted to know animals.Between the two of them, on those rare occasions when the one might call upon the other for his expert knowledge, it had become a game, a competition, no less than the chess game they played once a week in the Inspector's study at his home in Dalkeith. For here, too, however serious the case, they vied one with the other, trying each other's minds to see which would come closest to the truth. The beauty of it was this: in chess there's only one winner, but here they could both win."Like a dog?" Ianson looked again, deeply into McGowan's watery eyes, his wrinkled face. Old Angus: all five foot four or five of him, shrivelled as last year's walnuts, but standing tall now with some sure knowledge, some inner secret that loaned him stature. Nodding, and careful to avoid the bloodied snow, he went to one knee. Not that it mattered greatly--no need to worry about the destruction of evidence now; the scenes-of-crime men had been and gone all of an hour ago--but Angus didn't want this poor devil's blood on his good overcoat.Looking up at Ianson from where he kneeled--and had the situation been other than it was--the slighter man might well have grinned. Instead he grimaced, tapped the side of his dripping nose with his index finger, and answered, "Shall we say--oh, Ah dinnae ken--a dog o'sorts? Shall we say, a dog, or a bitch, o' a different colour? Like maybe, grey?"A great grey dog. Angus could mean only one sort of beast. Ridiculous! Except he wasn't given to making ridiculous statements. Wherefore:"From a zoo?" Ianson gripped McGowan's shoulder as he made to straighten up. "Or maybe a circus? Have you heard of an escape, then? Has one got out?""One what?" The other was all wide-eyed innocence."Come now, Angus!" The Inspector tut-tutted. "A wild creature of thesnows, like a great, grey, handsome dog? You can only be hinting at a wolf, surely?""Hintin', is it!" the other chuckled, however drily, and was serious in a moment. "Ah'm no hintin', George. Ye want mah opinion? This was a wolf, aye! An' one hell of a wolf at that! But escaped frae a zoo ... ?" He shook his head; not in denial, more out of puzzlement. "Ah've never come across a beast this size--no in any zoo in England, Scotland or Wales, at least. And as for yere circuses--what, at this time of year? Certainly no up here! An' so, well, Ah really canna say; Ah mean, Ah wouldnae care to commit mahsel'.""But you've done exactly that," the Inspector pointed out. "The piece is moved, Angus. You can't put it back.""Wolf, aye!" the other snapped, more decisively now. "But as for how she got here, her origin ..." He offered a twitch of his thin shoulders, stamped numb feet, blew into cupped hands. "It's your move, George. It's your move.""Me ... I say we move in out of the cold!" Ianson shook himself, both mentally and physically, breathed deeply of the wintry air, deliberately forced himself to draw back from the morbid spell, the dreadful fascination of the case--for the moment, anyway. For if McGowan was right, which in all likelihood he was (or there again not, for after all, the Inspector did have information to the contrary), then it was out of his hands. Murder by a man is one thing ... but by a dog, a wolf, or some other wild creature, then it becomes something else: a savaging, a misadventure, simply a killing. (And what of a man and a dog?) But if McGowan was right, then they'd need to call in a different kind of hunter with a very different brief: to kill on sight!Old Angus guessed what he was thinking--the latter part of it, anyway--and was quick to say, "But first we must try to prove it, or narrow down the suspects, at least.""Back to the house?" Ianson ducked out into the open with his small friend close behind. The house he referred to was one of a picturesque cluster standing some three hundred yards away across the footbridge. Once a great farm with outbuildings, now Sma' Auchterbecky housed a small community, scarcely a hamlet, in the very lee of the mountains."Ah can make a few calls frae there, aye," Angus nodded. "D'ye see the telephone wires?""And I've a few more questions for the girl," the Inspector replied, turning up the collar of his coat. He scanned the land all about, noted that it had started to snow again: great fat flakes that fell straight out of a leaden sky. In the lowering atmosphere there was little or no wind."A pretty enough place in the summer," McGowan commented. "But in the winter? A hell o' a place for a man tae die. Huh! An' a hell o' a way for one tae die, too!" They stood side by side a while, scanning the valley between the hills. Nearby, a police Land Rover hunched on the verge at the side of the road, also a squad car fitted with snow chains, and an ambulance with its rear doors open, waiting. The blue lights of the vehicles, silently revolving, loaned eerie, intermittent illumination to the handful of stamping, arm-flapping uniformed policemen and paramedics in attendance. Exhaust fumes from the Land Roverwent up in a blue-grey spiral, mimicking the smoke from the cluster of near-distant cottage chimneys.Ianson signalled the paramedics forward; now they could take the body--its remains--out of here. The forensic lab in Edinburgh would be its next port of call, then the morgue. But there wouldn't be much gutting of this one. He'd had more than his fair share of that already."A hell of a way to die?" The Inspector echoed his companion curiously, enigmatically. "Or maybe a weird sort of ... I don't know, justice, maybe?" There was that in his voice which caused old McGowan to glance at him sharply. Something he'd not been informed of, then? Oh, the vet would stand by his claim to the bitter end, that this was the work of a wolf. For he'd seen (indeed he had sensed, felt) evidence which to him was indisputable. But Ianson was the policeman after all, and a damned good one! Anyway, it wouldn't do to press the point; a man can't be seen to know too much, or he might have too much explaining to do. A hunch is one thing, but an assertion needs proving."Justice?" Angus let his sharp tone reveal his own suspicions. "Somethin' ye've nae told me, George?" It was hardly surprising; this was the way their game usually went.Ianson's smile was grim. "Oh, a lot to come from this yet, Angus ... not least from you! Nothing's solved until everything is known." And before the other could question further: "Let's get on over to the house now. We can talk as we go ..." <BR>"I know him," Ianson admitted, as they crossed the footbridge."The victim?""Victim, villain, whatever," the Inspector shrugged. "John Moffat's his name. I wouldn't have known his body--who would? But I recognized his face. Moffat, aye: prime suspect in a murder case in Glasgow just a year ago. Then, too, he'd done it in the snow; a park on the outskirts of the city, in the wee small hours of the morning. The same modus operandi: he dug a hole in a snowdrift, chose a prostitute on her way home and dragged her in. He raped and murdered her. Slit her throat ear to ear. He'd been seen in the park earlier. There were one or two other bits of inconclusive evidence ... not enough to pin it on him.""He walked away frae it." McGowan nodded."But not away from this one," Ianson's voice was grim. "So it's one down ... but it's still one to go.""Ye're saying that this was ... what, revenge? Which means ye believe it was a man. A man and his bloody big dog, maybe?"Ianson glanced at him out the corner of his eye. "Maybe," he answered. "Which would put the whammy on your wolf theory."The other made no reply. It suited him either way. He knew that Ianson wouldn't have asked him along if he hadn't at least suspected a large canine or some other animal. The Inspector had admitted as much."I only know that someone protected the girl," Ianson went on. "Except he did too damn thorough a job of it!""Someone close to the Glasgow prostitute, maybe?""Eh? Aye, possibly. Close to that one, anyway.""Oh? Has there been more than one, then? Unfair, George!" McGowan tut-tutted. "A man cannae play if the lights are out! Ah have tae know all yere moves.""One more at least," Ianson said. "Gleneagles, two winters ago.""In the snow again! And no too far away, at that. A prostitute, was she?""Aye. We didn't find that one until the first of the warm weather when the snow melted. She'd been there a month or more. Any evidence had been washed away. Our wee man back there could have done it, though. Again, same modus operandi. But of course we didn't know him then. He didn't come into the picture until the Glasgow thing.""And that's it?""That's it for the prostitute murders ... well, as far as I'm aware. Of course there could be others we don't know about. People disappear and are never found--as well you know." And again he gave that sideways glance."But if our man John Moffat wasnae linked to the Gleneagles murder, and if who or whatever killed him was somebody out for revenge, then this new killer can only be someone who knew the Glasgow girl, surely?"Ianson frowned. "Or someone who knew John Moffat, what he was doing--someone close to him, maybe?--who thought it was time he was stopped.""No just someone protectin' this girl especially, then?""Eh?" Ianson paused and stared hard at the other. "When I said she'd been protected, I meant by accident; by someone just happening on the scene, as it were.""Ye hadnae thought o' the other sort o' protection, then? That this one's pimp might have been lookin' out for her?""Pimp?""Well, it follows that if yere man only kills whores, the girl must be one. And if so, she probably has a pimp. Someone--and his dog?--who was waiting for her when she got dropped off last night!"The Inspector started, then grinned and took the other's arm above the elbow. Frail as old Angus seemed, the resilience of his flesh never failed to surprise Ianson; he felt the muscles move under the man's clothing, bunching at his unexpected grip as if resenting it. "Now see!" Ianson said. "What a grand team we make! Why, it's possible ye've just hit the nail right on the head!"McGowan freed himself and said, "Maybe. But it's like ye said: nothing's solved until everything is known." And now it was time to change direction again: "Personally, well, Ah still opine tae a big animal. On its own. A wild thing come down out o' the hills tae hunt.""I thought we had discounted the wolf theory?" The Inspector was making for the houses again."No, you had," McGowan told him. "But me, Ah have several theories. See, if ye'd no told me about they other murders, or that this John Moffat was a suspect, Ah'd still be thinkin' in terms o' a wild yin. And deep down inside, Ah still am.""A wild one? How long ago since there was a wild wolf in Scotland, Angus?""Two hundred and fifty years, that we know of," the other answered. "ButScotland's a big place, and plenty of wild country still. All over the world the wolves are stealin' back down frae the north, so why not here?""Because we're an island, Angus, that's why!""Is that so? Then explain the big cats on Bodmin Moor, and Dartmoor, and other places. Sheep killers, them--and real!""Not proven," Ianson said."Proven for mah money!" McGowan snorted. "Ah was down in Devon and Cornwall, remember? They called me in on it. No, Ah didnae see the beasts in question, but Ah saw their handiwork! Big cats, George. Take mah word for it!""My God, you'll be swearing an oath on Nessie yet!" Ianson grinned. "They called you in on that one, too, didn't they?""That American team? Three months' work there, George. It was the easiest money Ah ever made in mah life! What? A summer holiday on the banks o' Loch Ness, with all found and money in the bank?" McGowan chuckled and smacked his lips, and then was serious again. "Anyway, Ah was only a 'technical adviser.' Ah didnae have tae believe ... no as long as they thought Ah did! But a wolf is no a plesiosaur, George. They big yins have been gone a long time, but there are still wolves in the world.""Not in Scotland," the other was stubborn."Ah, but there could be soon enough!""Eh?""There's talk o' stocking a sanctuary somewhere up north. They'd have tae cull them, o' course, or shoot any that strayed too far. But there's a study on it.""Really?""Well why not? The wolves have been here just as long as we have. And there are still foxes, after all. Even the cities have foxes! Ah mean, is it no ridiculous? The Irish have their Irish wolfhounds--and never a wolf to be found!""Except here?"But Angus only shrugged. From now on he would take a back seat and only do or say what was expected of him. He had talked of men and he had talked of wolves, but he'd not once mentioned the creature in between. Nor would he. Unlike the Loch Ness Monster, who really didn't exist, that would be just too close for comfort. But in the final analysis--if and when it should come to it--it would be no bad thing for Inspector George Ianson to have a wolf on his mind ... or even a werewolf. For as a legend the creature was far enough removed from certain other myths to make it unique in its own right. No one in his right mind would confuse an isolated case (or even an outbreak) of strictly medical or pathological lycanthropy with vampirism. It might alert humanity to the one type of monster in its midst, but the other would remain obscure as ever ... <BR>While the Inspector talked to the girl, Margaret Macdowell, old Angus spent the time on the telephone. When both were done they thanked the girl for coffee and sandwiches, then walked back to Ianson's car. It was snowing again and the path was white under foot.On their way into Edinburgh, they talked:"No whore, that lady," Ianson said. "She sells booze, not her body. Works at a wine bar in Edinburgh. That's why she was late home: late opening hours. It might easily have been later still, but her boss lets her off early if the forecast is bad. As you probably overheard, Moffat had been frequenting the bar, chatting up the other girls, too, but paying particular attention to Margaret Macdowell. She knew his first name, that's all. She did recognize him, however--barely, or briefly--during the attack, after he'd dragged her into his ... what, his den? And she knew that he would kill her. Before she passed out she sensed that someone was there. And she woke up to ... all that mess! She thinks she remembers snarling and savage motion, and something of Moffat's gibbering. And that's about it.""Ye spoke to her before the police drove me up here," old Angus was thinking out loud. "Didnae ye get any o' this then?""She was tired, shaken, shocked," Ianson shrugged. "Still is, but refuses treatment. Can't say I blame her. She has a few bruises, that's all. She's young and the shock won't last. Yes, I got something of it, but the stuff about the snarling is new. She may remember more as she settles down.""So, no whore," McGowan mused."But easily mistaken for one," the other returned. "A bar girl--all long legs, a backside like an apple, and a half-bare bosom--decked out in a short dress, black stockings and garters, serving drinks to a mainly male clientele. Oh, our Mr. Moffat could easily get the wrong idea, I'm sure.""A modern Jack the Ripper," McGowan grunted."Except this one got ripped," Ianson reminded him, grimly. "And no surgical instruments did that to him, be sure.""A man and his dog," old Angus mused. "But no tracks ...""The snow," the Inspector grunted."So, what's next?""For you? I expect you'll carry on contacting and checking out all the zoos and wild-life parks in the area," Ianson glanced at the smaller man. "So that we can be absolutely sure that there's been no escape. I'd certainly appreciate it, Angus, for they'll talk more easily to you than to me. As for me ... I'll need to be talking to the other girls at Margaret Macdowell's place of work: B.J.'s Wine Bar, in town. But I've little doubt they'll corroborate all she's said.""So why bother?""Oh, routine," Ianson shrugged. "Who knows, maybe they can tell me more about John Moffat? Did he have any enemies or such that they might know of? That sort of thing.""Like a man and his dog?""Just so ..."Or, the Inspector wondered, maybe a woman and her dog? On that point, there'd been several occasions when the old vet had mentioned a "she" in connection with his wolf. Like "she" was a big yin, and so forth. And anyway, why had Angus strayed so far from his argument, his original conclusion? Had he or hadn't he given up on his wolf theory? What about his telephone calls?"Who did you speak to, Angus?" Ianson glanced at him. "The zoo people in Edinburgh?""They're on mah list. Ah have tae do it, ye understand, if only tae settle it in mah own mind.""But in fact you've given up on it now?"Old Angus merely shrugged."Well?""Murder by dog. It seems more and more feasible ..."The Inspector was mildly concerned. McGowan was saying so very little now; probably because he was ... what, hiding something? This was usually how he was before making some surprise move on the chess board. Maybe Ianson should look more closely at the case from old Angus's point of view--wherever that was coming from! Since he now seemed to be making light of his wolf theory, perhaps the Inspector should pay more attention to it.Except, if Angus was onto something, Ianson felt certain he wouldn't get much more out of him just yet. Wherefore a second opinion might be in order. And if his memory served him, he knew just where he might find a lead to that second opinion: in the unsolved files at Police HQ in Edinburgh ... <BR>After dropping McGowan off at his place in a sagging, decaying district east of the city, the Inspector called in at Police HQ and made a request to Records: for a list of attacks, savagings by animals, of people and livestock, occurring in the last five years. Then a quick call to New Scotland Yard for more information, and by the time he was through Records had run off some stuff for him. Too much stuff: the incidence of animal attacks, usually by "pet" dogs, was surprisingly high.He spoke to the clerk in charge and asked him about older cases: "Some thirty years ago? I was new on the force, but seem to remember a case somewhere up north that made a big splash at the time. A sighting? A savaging, at one of the wildlife parks, followed by the resignation of a local policeman. He quit after his report was rubbished and he was ridiculed. Do you think you could dig it out for me?"The clerk, a man thin and tall as Ianson himself, wearing spectacles, squinted at him and said, "Thirty years ago? That's a hell of a memory you've got, Inspector! But I'm afraid those old files aren't on microfiche. It could take a while. However, I'll make a search if that's what you'd like."Ianson nodded. "Yes, go ahead. If you find the file, you can contact me at home." <BR>He took the sheaf of papers home with him to his spacious garret flat in Dalkeith, made himself a light lunch, then took his food and work both into his study and sat with them at his desk under a huge sloping skylight. Ianson liked natural light best, even when it was the dim grey light of winter. His chess board stood on a small table to one side of the room, with the pieces in position just as he and old Angus had left them some nights earlier. They would get to finish the game eventually, but now there was bigger "game afoot."Munching on chicken salad sandwiches, the Inspector began scanning the pages of information printed out for him from Police HQ's microfiche files. But after a minute or two, realizing that it would take a while to separate outthe stuff that interested him, and because tonight he intended to visit B.J.'s Wine Bar in the city, he paused to make a telephone call and reserve a little time with the boss of the bar now.Margaret Macdowell had given him the number; using it, he found his call answered by a female voice with a soft Scottish burr. He asked for the proprietor, and was told:"That'll be mahsel'--Bonnie Jean Mirlu.""Miss Mirlu--or is it Missus?--perhaps you're already aware of the attack on one of your girls last night?" And following that up quickly, in case she hadn't heard: "I'm talking about Margaret Macdowell--but I'd like to reassure you that she came to no harm. I'm the Inspector on the case.""It's Miss," the voice told him. "Just call me B.J. And Ah've heard, yes--Margaret called and told me. Is there somethin' Ah can do for ye, Inspector, er ... ?""Ianson. George Ianson. I've a question or two you could perhaps help me with, routine stuff. Perhaps tonight, opening hours? I'll make it brief as possible and try not to keep you from your business.""But what could Ah possibly know? It was miles frae here, and he wasnae even a regular customer. Just a pest to the lassies, that's all.""You knew him, then? I really must come to see you, B.J."She sighed and answered, "Well if ye must ye must, but Ah cannae see what ye're hopin' tae learn frae me.""How many of you are there ... in the bar, I mean?""Four, all girls, and mahsel'. But ye'll surely no be wanting to question us all, now will ye?""Probably. But only a few minutes each, I promise.""Verra well, then," she agreed, grudgingly. "Say, eightish?""That'll do nicely," he told her. "Until tonight, then."But after putting the phone down, the Inspector sat frowning to himself before returning to his papers. Something about her accent, he thought. Oh, it was a very good imitation, but it wasn't the real thing, wasn't the genuine article. Or maybe it was too genuine.He pondered it a while longer, then snapped his fingers. That was it! B.J. Mirlu's accent wasn't phony at all; it was simply out of date, not quite the modern vernacular he was used to hearing in the city. She sounded more like something out of the last century--out of the Highlands, maybe--like Granny Ianson, God bless her, when George was a lad. Maybe this B.J. Mirlu was from up north, then, and the high-faultin' accents of Edinburgh still alien to her tongue. It was something he would have to ask her, if only to satisfy his own curiosity.. <BR>It took the Inspector some two hours to sort through the photocopy files. Closed cases (prosecutions mainly, brought by individual complainants on their own behalf, or by the parents of children savaged by "pet" or domesticated dogs, and a number of cases where enraged farmers had shot dead strays found worrying their flocks) went into one sheaf, and open cases into another. Then this second sheaf was sub-divided into attacks on animals, on people, and sightings;the latter because there was no lack of reports of large, generally unspecified creatures wandering in the wild. Just such cases as interested Angus McGowan.But the Inspector would have nothing to do with the likes of Bodmin Moor wildcats, great hounds of Dartmoor or Nessie o' the Loch. His monsters--the monsters of his calling--were invariably human. Or in this case, maybe a bit of both. A man and his dog, aye. Or maybe a woman and her dog ...Before Ianson could look at the relevant parts of the sub-divided paperwork, his phone rang: a call from a friend at New Scotland Yard, in Criminal Records. "George, we got your request," Peter Yanner told him. Yanner was an ex-Inspector seeing out his time to retirement behind a desk. "And I saw the morning's sitreps. You'll be working on that case at, er, Auchterbecky?""Sma' Auchterbecky," Ianson corrected him. "Nasty stuff, Peter. One case closed, and another opened.""Indeed," said the other. "And I suppose you'll be torn two ways: glad to see the one go down, but unhappy that a new one's come up. Like the gang wars down here. We're never too unhappy about it when a bad lad gets hit, but there's always the question of who did it. A pity they can't all kill themselves off, eh?""Murder is murder," Ianson replied. "John Moffat's paid his dues, but who to?" He shrugged, if only to himself, then asked: "So what have you got for me?""I'm just trying to clarify things," the other answered. "Big dog attacks, you said: animals. But what about lycanthropy?""Eh?""We had this bloke who thought he was a werewolf. A cop-killer, too! That was three, maybe three and a half years ago. We got him ... but the whole case was weird. There were a lot of threads left dangling, you know? But when the Home Office puts the cap on something, that's it, case closed.""So?" The Inspector's mind had begun to switch elsewhere as soon as lycanthropy was mentioned. He couldn't see any connection with the current case; he had taken in very little of what he'd been told. "No big savage dog, then? No genuine big dog, anyway.""Well that's why I phoned you," the other explained. "I mean, you can't get much bigger than a werewolf, now can you?"Finally Ianson's mind focused. He knew that this wasn't for him, yet his instincts told him to follow it up. "You say the case is closed? You got him? So what makes you think that I'd be interested? I mean, lycanthropy, Peter? What's on your mind?""It's just funny, that's all ...""Funny?""Not ha-ha, just funny. OK, you're probably not in the picture, so let me explain. This thing with the werewolf: the guy was killed with a crossbow, with silvered arrowheads.""What? The police used a crossbow?" Ianson was lost again."No, whoever killed him did.""We had outside help, then. The SAS?""No.""Secret service?""Not that I know of. Just someone out to get him, as far as I know." And before Ianson could question further: "Then, a couple of months ago, we had this other case up in your neck of the woods.""What case was that?" (His neck of the woods? The Inspector's attention was suddenly riveted.)"Murder, up on the Spey not far from Kincraig? You surely remember those Tibetans who got killed, George? Sectarian warfare or some such? Two dead up there in a wrecked car, and a whole bunch of them got tossed out of the country."Ianson frowned. "I remember the headlines but I wasn't on the case. It was outside my jurisdiction. Anyway, what does it have to do with attacks by big dogs--or lycanthropy, for that matter?""A possible connection, that's all," Yanner told him. "It was the same kind of murder weapon: a crossbow. The same silvered arrowheads, too ...""Boltheads," Ianson growled, more to himself than to the other."What's that?""A crossbow doesn't shoot arrows but bolts.""Whatever," Yanner answered. "But a silver bolt killed our werewolf nut, and likewise one of these Hari Krishna types. The other one fried in the wrecked car. It might not mean anything, I don't know. I just sort of connected it up, that's all. A so-called werewolf, and a crossbow with silvered arrowheads--er, boltheads! And your request for stuff on dog or big animal attacks: Scotland, murder, and silver boltheads again. A bit of a tangle, I know, but that's how my mind works."Ianson licked his lips, then shook his head despite that Yanner couldn't see him. "But what is there to connect the murder last night and these killings on the Spey? I mean, how does our John Moffat fit in? I don't see it, Peter.""Me neither, but that's not what I'm paid for. I only keep the books. You're the man on the ground. Anyway, maybe I should have kept my nose out. I'm sorry if I've confused the issue.""No, no, not at all. In fact you've interested me greatly. Let me have all you've got on this lycanthropy thing, will you? I mean, as well as the routine stuff?""Sure.""And the case is closed, you say?""Yep.""Without a murderer? A second murderer, I mean?"(An invisible shrug). "The guy was a cop-killer, George.""And everyone involved was satisfied with the conclusion?""Apparently.""Weird!""That's what I told you ...""Peter, thanks for calling.""You're welcome. And this stuff will be on its way ASAP.""Cheers ..." And slowly, Ianson put the phone down. <BR>After that the paperwork was boring ... for a while. Until the Inspector began glancing through the "sightings" list. At first he would read, shake his head andmuttering disbelievingly to himself put the report aside. These so-called "sightings" covered just about every eventuality."Nessie" was in there, of course (as reported by a drunken gamekeeper to the police station in Drumnadrochit). Also feral cats in an attack on a chicken farm at Aboyne; stray dogs worrying sheep at Braemar near Balmoral, and also at the foot of Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh itself. And ...... And wolves seen at Newtonmore, Blair Atholl, and in the Pass of Killiecrankie. Also at Crianlarich under Ben More, and at Carrbridge and Nethybridge on the Spey! Great grey wolves, by God! Half a dozen cases. Too many bloody wolves by far!So, perhaps old McGowan did know something after all. But if so, why wasn't he saying anything? Or could it be (the Inspector gave his head a worried shake) that he, George Ianson, was simply letting himself get tangled up in this thing--in a load of hogwash, that is? And what the hell, weren't there always boogy men in these out-of-the-way places? And wouldn't there always be a Nessie lurking in the loch? Well, yes. Just as long as there were tourists there would be, for sure!A great grey dog with eyes like lanterns seen padding the road on a misty night at Newtonmore ... a wolf? Not a bit of it, just a big dog. And the pair spied in the Pass of Killiecrankie? Rationalization: a man out walking his Alsatian dogs steps into the bushes for a pee. His dogs stand waiting; they maybe rear up a little, and draw back onto the verge as a car passes. The motorist--with a dram or two under his belt, no doubt--sees their eyes turn to flames in his main beams. As for the valley of the Spey: why, a man could swear to seeing anything on a misty, moonlit night, on those winding wooded lanes and rocky hillsides! Damn, it was only a year ago that they'd been seeing flying saucers! And the same down in Sussex, and crop circles in Devon and Dorset!So what was it that was bothering him, Ianson wondered? And a moment later believed he had the answer. He hadn't been able to remember much about it at Police HQ but now recalled it clearly enough. These damned silly reports had jogged his memory: about that constable who had quit his job some thirty years ago over just such a sighting. But there'd been more to it than that. Not just a sighting ... but a killing, too! Not of a man but an animal! And not just any animal but a bison! A creature as big as that, gutted!As for the location ...... It had taken place at the Highland wildlife park near Kincraig. Then the park had been the merest nucleus of what it was now; indeed, it hadn't opened properly until sixteen years later. Even so, it had been stocked with a canny complement of "Highland" creatures, many of which had vanished from Scotland centuries ago: brown bears, beaver, reindeer and the like. And bison, yes.Kincraig. On the River Spey. And these Tibetans had died there, too. And then there'd been those sightings up at Carrbridge and Nethybridge. But as for wolves--and bloody werewolves, by God!--why, Ianson could almost break out laughing at himself. But he didn't, and wouldn't. Not until he checked with the wildlife park that they didn't have wolves, too!Was that what old Angus had been hinting at? Had he been laughing up his sleeve at Ianson when he'd told him there was a scheme afoot to re-introducewolves into some wild place up north? Had he known that they had already introduced them? In which case he was cheating! What, old Angus? Huh! His "A man cannae play if the lights are out!" And, "Ah have tae know a' yere moves, George." The canny old devil!It should be easy enough to check out. A call to the park could settle it right now. Except the Inspector knew that something else was bothering him, something out of myth and legend. He snapped his fingers as suddenly it came to him: silver! Silvered crossbow bolts! And you'd need a silver weapon to kill a werewolf, wouldn't you?So, just what sort of outside help had the Metropolitan Police called in that time to deal with their lycanthrope; or rather, their lunatic? And whoever the hunter was, why had he used a silvered crossbow bolt? Not for the "obvious" reason, surely? Or was he some kind of lunatic, too ... ?The Inspector sat there a long time, just thinking ... or not thinking very much at all. Sometimes things worked themselves out better that way.The light was fading. Short days, long nights, and a full moon rising. Ianson remembered it from a night or two ago when he'd sat in here with some case or other: the moon nearing its full, hanging low over the horizon. So last night ... would it have been full?Now what was he thinking? What the hell was he thinking?He stood up, stretched, glanced at his watch. God, it was 4:45 already! The afternoon had flown. And going to the window he looked out across the rooftops of Dalkeith, to where a full moon was three-quarters free of the grey evening haze ...He turned on the lights, headed back towards his desk, and jumped like a shot rabbit when the phone rang. It was the records clerk at Central HQ. "I'll be shutting up shop in a couple of minutes," he said. "Just thought you'd like to know, I found your case file--that business at Kincraig nearly thirty years ago? Will you call in for it tomorrow, or what?""No," Ianson told him. "I'll be in town tonight. Leave it with the information desk, will you? I'll pick it up there.""Very well, as long as you'll sign for it. And one other thing. That constable you mentioned who resigned? I traced him through the pay office ... a disability pension for some small injury he got as a serving officer. He's Gavin Strachan: a Kingussie man, but he moved down here shortly after quitting.""Down here?""One of those coincidences. Lives not far from you in Dalkeith. A ten-minute walk along the Penicuik Road."The Inspector was grateful and said, "Thanks. That takes a lot of the effort out of it.""You're welcome. And goodnight.""Goodnight," Ianson answered automatically. And glancing at the moon again through his window, he hoped it would be. It had started out good, anyway ... <BR>Since it was too early to eat, and much too early to get ready for his appointment at B.J.'s Wine Bar, Ianson checked through the reports again. Now he waslooking at cases covering attacks on people. And though five years was a long time, still, in his opinion--based on the number of savagings alone--there were far too many Rottweilers and Dobermanns around! As for the incidence of people bitten in the face ... it was horrific! Worse, several of these attacks had been fatals.What the hell is it in a dog, the Inspector wondered, that will make it bite a child in the face? And what the hell was it that caused them to carry on even after they'd reduced the victim to a bundle of red rags? The wolf in them, he supposed. The only good thing was that in almost every case where a rogue pet dog had savaged someone, the beast had been easily tracked back to its owner. And nine out of ten such animals--the dogs, that is--had been destroyed. Ianson had never been much of a dog-lover, and he didn't go a lot on their owners, either.And then there were the unsolved cases ...But the Inspector's eyes were tired; the rest of the reports could wait; he would take a break from the paperwork and try contacting ex-constable Gavin Strachan instead. He was in the book--several of them were, in fact. Ianson matched addresses with the one he'd got from the records clerk and gave his man a call."Eh?" said a rough voice at the other end of the line."Good evening, sir," Ianson answered. "Gavin Strachan?""Aye. What is it?""Ex-constable Strachan?""Eh? No for a long time, it isn't! Anyway, what of it?""Inspector Ianson," Ianson told him. "We never met, but I would certainly like to.""Why?" (Strachan's voice was rough as sandpaper, and full of suspicion.)"Oh, routine," (Ianson's stock answer). "A case you dealt with up in Kincraig thirty years ago--something that happened at the wildlife park ... ?"For a moment there was silence, then: "Some kind o' joke?" Strachan's voice was harsher still."Joke? Not at all. I'd just like to hear it from you what really happened that night. What you think you saw.""Think, is it? But Ah told them what Ah think thirty years ago--told the newspapers, too. Hah! Tellin' mah story was like pissin' in the wind. Aye, and it pissed mah career away, too!""Mr. Strachan, I--""Fuck ye!" the other cut him off, and slammed the phone down ...Copyright © 1996 by Brian Lumley

Sunup!The sun had risen up fifteen times since the battle for The Dweller's garden; risen up over the southwestern horizon, travelled a predestined path according to its cycle, sunk down again into the southeast. Fifteen times that low, warm, oh so lazy golden arc across the sky, making for a like number of sundowns.Sundown: night, darkness, peril!Sundown. A time of terror since time immemorial: when the last yellow glints would slip silently from the high crags of the great barrier range, until its topmost peaks turned a pale ochre, then ashen, finally wolf-grey and silver under the stars of Starside. A time of terror, yes ... but no longer. For the battle in The Dweller's garden had been fought and won, and the near-immortal masters of Starside's aeries, the Wamphyri, were immortal no longer. Indeed, they were either dead or flown into the Icelands. Of the latter, only a few had survived to flee.Sundown, and nothing to fear from it. Not any more. It was strange ...On the one side of the mountains, that closest to the sun (Sunside, with its forests and rivers, and, to the south, its pitiless furnace lands), daylight would persist for a further twenty-five hours; but on Starside the barrier mountains shut out the sun's life-giving warmth, leaving only the stars and the aurora over the Icelands to light the rugged land. So it had always been, so it would always be.Except upon a time there had also been the Wamphyri! ... But now there was none. Not in Starside, anyway. No vampires here but one, and he was different. He was The Dweller.And at the beginning of that new night, that fifteenth sundown in the New Age of Starside, The Dweller had called for Lardis Lidesci to attend him at his house in the garden high over Starside's boulder plains.Lardis was a Traveller king, leader of one of Sunside's Szgany tribes. He was short, barrel-bodied, apelike in the length of his arms; his lank black hair framed a wrinkled, weather-beaten face, with a flattened nose and a wide mouth full of strong, uneven teeth. Under wild eyebrows, Lardis's brown eyes glittered his mind's agility, even as he himself was agile despite his stumpy shape. Yes, he was Szgany, and it showed."Szgany": in fact the word had two meanings. Starside's trogs, cavern-dwelling neanderthals, likewise called themselves Szgany. To them it meant "The Obedient Ones"--obedient to the Wamphyri! As for the genesis of Traveller usage, that was lost in time. Now when the Gypsies used the word to define other than a trog, it best described themselves, their way of life: tinkers, music-makers, seekers after refuge (often in deep caverns, like the dwelling places of the trogs), wandering metalworkers, fey people: Szgany.Travellers. Ah, but upon a time--an oh so recent time--there had been reasons aplenty for the nomadic existence of the Gypsies! And each and every one of those reasons monstrous, and all of them inhabiting the stone- and bone-built aeries of the Wamphyri! But the Wamphyri were no more.It was strange; Lardis was not yet accustomed to it; the sun was setting for the fifteenth time and still he shivered, longing for the misted valleys, wooded slopes and forests of Sunside. Across the mountains it was still twilight and true dark many hours away. Plenty of time to find sanctuary in one or another of the many labyrinthine systems of caverns, there to wait out the night until ... But no, all of that was yesterday. Yet again Lardis must remind himself: Fool! The yoke is lifted. The Szgany are free!Pausing where he made his way through the garden, Lardis looked back and up at the topmost crags. They were ashen now: charcoal dusted a pale blue-grey from the brightening stars, the colour of a wolf at twilight. Soon the hurtling moon would be up, half golden in the sun's reflected light, half blue as Icelands sheen. Then the wolves of Sunside would sing up from the dark forests and down from the pine-clad mountains, and those of Starside would hear them, yawn and stretch, emerge from their treeline dens and answer with songs of their own. For the moon was mistress to all the grey brothers.Shivering (from the chill of twilight?) Lardis glanced all aboutin the dusk. At trog workers, leathery, shuffling, nocturnal, already up and about and seeing to their various duties; at the dim but reassuring yellow lights of Traveller dwellings huddled to the gently sloping walls of the saddle; at the misty silhouettes of greenhouses, the glitter of starlight in a shimmering geothermal pool, a creaking wind-vane atop its skeletal tower, turning in the breeze off Starside. And then he shivered again, and started out more urgently for The Dweller's house----Only to slow his pace in the very next moment. No need for haste. It was sundown, yes, but there was nothing hurtful here. Not anymore. So ... why should he feel that something was wrong?Lardis trusted his instincts. His mother used to read palms, and his father had seen far things; all of the Lidescis had been fey. And tonight Lardis was jumpy without knowing the reason. Could this be why The Dweller had called him, because something was wrong? Well, he would know soon enough. But one thing Lardis already knew: that he had heard the call of Sunside, its rivers, forests and open spaces, and come what may his stay would not be long in The Dweller's garden.Three acres in a row front to rear, the garden was--it had been--a marvellous place. It was a small valley in a gently hollowed mountain saddle. In this region Nature had flattened the barrier range somewhat; thus when the sun stood at its low southerly apex, it somehow managed to shine between even the highest peaks and down the long slopes, glancing off the crags to light here. From twilight to twilight, the aching light of Sunside struck through the pass in a great warm misty wedge.A long, curved dry-stone wall defined the garden's forward boundary, beyond which the ground dipped sharply towards frowning cliffs, weathered shelves, more declivities, gentling foothills, and finally Starside's barren plains. Encompassed by the wall, the slopes of the saddle, and a narrow pass at the rear, were small fields or allotments, greenhouses, wind-vanes, sheds and storehouses, and clearwater ponds. A number of pools were astir with trout; others bubbled with thermal activity. Lush with vegetation, much of it crushed and ravaged in the battle but already sprung up and growing again, a surprising number of the garden's vegetable species would have been at home in The Dweller's own world. Hardy, improved or developed by TheDweller himself, they had grown accustomed to Starside's long nights and longer, occasionally dreary, days.Repairs to the garden were nearing completion. Even stones slimed by exploding gas-beasts or evaporating Lords and lieutenants had been cleaned, or removed to the rim and avalanched down onto Starside. Vampire debris had gone into a crevasse, been drenched with The Dweller's fuels, burned up with hideous stenches. Eventually the last taint had been expunged. Broken dwellings had been mended, flattened greenhouses re-erected, The Dweller's generators repaired. Many of the garden's systems were fragile, requiring frequent attention; tending them was how The Dweller's people earned their keep, and the work served to instruct them in his ways.His "people": trogs sent by the Wamphyri to work mischief against him, only to be converted to his cause; a few Travellers from tribes other than Lardis Lidesci's, grateful for The Dweller's sanctuary; and Starside's grey brotherhood, the wild ones of the mountains, who hunted under the moon. These latest of his volunteers were wolves, but it was as if he were their brother--which indeed he might well be. For The Dweller's vampire had been passed to him by a wolf ...A vampire, aye--indeed, Wamphyri! For he carried a true egg. And if he were not The Dweller, with his own place here in the garden, what then? On Starside's boulder plains, east of the shining hemisphere portal to lands unknown, there stood the last great aerie of the Wamphyri. In its prime it had been the property of the Lord Dramal Doombody who, upon his demise, gifted it to his heir the Lady Karen. Might not The Dweller, himself Wamphyri, feel the aerie's alien lure, make it his own, take his machines there to light that monstrous stack as now they lit the garden?As for the Lady Karen herself:In the battle for the garden, Karen had sided with the defenders; moreover, she had brought first warning, and with her hybrid warriors had fought like a wildcat against the vampire Lords! Engaging Lesk the Glut, she'd opened his chest with her gauntlet, cut through the pipes of his heart, torn it smoking from his body while yet Lesk stamped and snorted! The Lady Karen: she had been something! But now ...Some said she lived in her aerie still, though Harry Keogh (called Hell-lander, and sometimes Dwellersire) would doubtlessdispute it; if he were fit and well enough to dispute anything. Harry Keogh: The Dweller's father, his bloodsire.After the battle, Harry had sojourned a while with Karen in her aerie; who but a magician out of the hell-lands would dare? She was after all Wamphyri! But upon his return to the garden he'd reported Karen's demise: how, in order to avoid some dark, unspoken fate, she had killed herself. Perhaps it was so, but mention her name to The Dweller and he would only smile. Except ... these days he wasn't much given to smiling.Lardis arrived at his destination: a white stone bungalow with round windows and a chalet-style roof, situated close to a hot spring. An exterior staircase of yellow-varnished pine zigzagged up to a small balcony under projecting eaves, which fronted The Dweller's bedroom in the hollow of the red-tiled roof. After the battle in the garden, when the house suffered exploding gas-beast blasts, only its shell had been left standing. Trogs and Travellers, working together under the direction of The Dwellers, had soon put it back to rights. Now it seemed The Dweller no longer took pride in it. Nor in any of his previous works.The Dweller waited in his doorway. He wore his golden mask, of course, and a voluminous yellow robe which covered his entire body down to his feet. Lardis paused before him, raised a clenched fist and uttered a customary greeting: "Tear down the mountains!" Customary, habitual, indeed instinctive, the ancient Szgany imprecation no longer had meaning. In return The Dweller nodded, took Lardis's elbow and escorted him to the long room which was his study. A circular window in an end wall looked out over Starside to the distant, shimmering horizon and the auroras of the far north. A second window in the opposing wall viewed the garden, the narrowing funnel of the saddle, the gaunt crags rising on both sides and merging into peaks. In the cleft of the pass the sky was a banded blue, where the sapphire in the well of the V shaded upwards into indigo to accommodate the first glitter of Sunside's stars.Seated on simple stools in soft yellow electric lamplight, the two men faced each other across a small pine table. Despite the fact that Lardis was The Dweller's senior by a good six or seven years, and a leader in his own right, he was ill at ease in the other's presence. He had felt this way, indeed increasingly so, almost from first arrival here. His discomfort might have its source in The Dweller's alien origins--the fact that he was abeing from an unknown world, commanding awesome weapons and powers--but that was only part of it. Rather Lardis sensed in him something of the ancient powers of this world (or more properly, of Starside), and for the most part his disquiet lay in knowing what stared back at him through the orbits of The Dweller's expressionless golden mask--scarlet Wamphyri eyes! Well, no secret there. For much to his credit The Dweller had disclosed all: the fact that he was the recipient of a vampire egg--from the bite of a wolf!Lardis, however, suspected that there was even more than this to his persistent disquiet. Gazing somewhat obliquely on his host, he felt that The Dweller's unseen eyes saw more than was their right, that they might even peer into a man's soul. Lardis's soul, like his conscience, was crystal clear, but his thoughts were never less than searching. He didn't much like the idea that perhaps The Dweller was also a thought-thief, a mentalist. Certainly the majority of the Old Wamphyri had had the power, in one degree or another.Finally The Dweller spoke. "You are silent." His voice was young, yet old with knowledge, with strangeness. It had a rough edge, a rasp of physical pain. Beneath his robe, The Dweller's burns were not yet healed. Not entirely.Lardis shrugged awkwardly, felt lost for an answer. "You sent for me. I came to discover your needs.""My needs?" The Dweller answered Lardis's shrug with one of his own. "I myself don't know what they are! But for the moment they are the needs of my people. Later ... we shall see."Lardis waited, and eventually:"I fear there are changes in the offing," said The Dweller, sighing. "There are several subjects to discuss. My mother, my father, myself. Yourself, and your people. The garden, and its future. If it has one."Still Lardis waited."The garden served a purpose, in its time," The Dweller continued. "It was a home, a refuge, even a fortress against the Wamphyri. Against their arrogance, anyway: their 'invincibility.' Well, they were not invincible. Nor am I. Nothing is. Also, the garden proved a point: that while a fixed, permanent home may be vulnerable, still it may be defended, and successfully. One of several things which made the Wamphyri strong was theirterritoriality. They would not suffer rivals within their spheres. Once they laid claim to a place--or to anything, for that matter--it was theirs forever, or as long as they could hold it. This was no weird idiosyncrasy; most creatures, once they have found their place, will not move lightly aside. And men are much the same. Which is how and why we held the garden and brought the Wamphyri down." He paused."In my father's country," The Dweller continued in a while, "in his world, they have this saying: 'An Englishman's home is his castle.' It may be translated as a warning: 'Make no threat against me on my own land, for here I am strong. Here, I am the master!" Again The Dweller paused, then asked, "Do you understand what I'm saying?"Lardis wasn't sure he did understand, but certainly he was worried. The Dweller's mode of expression sounded like nothing so much as a Wamphyri word game! And suddenly Lardis wondered: In the battle for the garden, was it his purpose to simply defend himself against the Wamphyri ... or to usurp them? If the latter, what did that make Lardis Lidesci and his people? Free men ... or thralls? Now that The Dweller alone held sway on Starside, how would he use his power?Finally Lardis found his voice. "Are these things applicable to me?""To you and yours, yes," The Dweller replied. "The Szgany fought for me and my garden. What they paid in blood has been returned in skill and knowledge; and in future, should the need arise, your people will know how to defend themselves. But for now ... what is there for you on Starside? What was there ever, but a threat? Well, the threat is no more. So go back to Sunside, quit your travelling, build settlements and live in peace--for as long as you may. You've earned yourselves a breathing space, time of your own in which to grow strong. Only remember: the vampire swamps are still there. If ever the Wamphyri should return, whether bred in the swamps or ... other places, next time be ready for them."Lardis had been holding his breath. He let it out in a sigh which was almost a gasp. For while still puzzled, he was also relieved. He need no longer feel guilty about his intentions; his mind had been made up to leave, which coincided with The Dweller's advice. As for certain other fears in respect of The Dweller's purpose, he saw now that they had been unworthy."Before the next sunup," he finally replied, "I'll take my people out of here. Until then, if you'll help us, we'll learn all we can from you. As for fighting the Wamphyri, in that we are of one mind. I have always fought them. And if they return I'll fight them again."Under the rim of The Dweller's mask where it enclosed his cheekbones and housed his nose in a prow, his lips twitched into a smile. He nodded and said, "Yes, I know--but in the past you have fought with muscle, blood, bone. The next time will be with 'science.' Ah, you think you don't know the word, but you do! You've seen it at work, here, all about you! In your permanent settlements, the towns you'll build, there will be time for it. Time for all manner of things, now that your endless trekking is at an end! 'Science,' yes: it means to learn and to understand ... everything! What? And is everything too much for you? Well, perhaps it is. But you Szgany are a crafty people; metalworkers, weapon-makers, skills left over from a time before the Wamphyri. Just a little learning, even a little science ... Why, there's nothing in this garden you couldn't make! Nothing of my technology which you can't discover and duplicate for yourselves, given time."Lardis felt a great excitement, but at the same time he was frowning again. For now he detected something else in The Dweller's tone, words between his words. There was a sense of--finality?--in the things he said. But if the Szgany were at a beginning, who then was at an end? Or ... who suspected that his end was upon him?"Other matters," The Dweller painfully rasped, his urgency cutting into the Gypsy's thoughts; so that again Lardis wondered, Mentalist? Thought-thief? While out loud he said:"You, yourself, Dweller?"The Dweller gave a smart start, and now it was his turn to wonder. The Gypsy was shrewd. Had Lardis been anticipating his host or simply answering some question of his own? Had he seen the pain in The Dweller's scorched face, heard it in his voice? Had he perhaps guessed that The Dweller's sun-poisoned flesh was dying? Well, possibly, but even a shrewd man could scarcely guess the whole truth, the final truth--that even now The Dweller's vampire was reshaping what untainted flesh remained. But into what?"Myself."Lardis nodded. "If we Travelers--we Szgany, since it appears we'll journey no more--if we leave the garden, then what of you, your trogs, your people? What of those Travellers who were here before me and mine? What of your mother ... aye, and your father? What of Harry Hell-lander? This is the second sundown he's tossed and babbled in his strange fever. Who knows how long before he'll recover? Last but not least, what of the garden?"The Dweller nodded. "We'll deal with all of these things in their turn. My mother ... is failing. I have watched her grow old while in fact she's still young. In the world where she was born, women of her age are still in their prime, but that was never her destiny." Now his rasping voice turned a little sour. "From the day she met my father the shape of her life was preordained, with never a chance that it might run a straight course. She wasn't weak, but neither was she strong ... enough. She was ordinary, and Harry is--he was--extraordinary. And yet her life has not been miserable; indeed she has been happy, here in the garden. The nature of her affliction is that it shuts out all manner of horrid things from her mind, until almost everything has been shut out. And now she dwells alone, within.""Not alone, Dweller!" Lardis protested.The Dweller held up a slender hand. "I know, I know: my people look after her well, and are rewarded with her smiles. But such responses are automatic; she merely obeys her instincts; she is mainly alone--but not for long. Soon she'll join that throng who went before, going on from this place like a vine growing over the wall. Well, and it's true there are worlds beyond and I mustn't be greedy. So let it be: let her simple smile brighten some other's garden a while. Until then I'll stay with her, along with a few others of my people who won't leave her ..." He paused a moment. And in a little while:"As for you and your people, Lardis: you'll prosper on Sunside, I'm sure. And myself? Well, I looked after myself, my mother, the garden, long before the first of you Szgany joined me here; and now ... I have friends other than trogs and Travellers. What's more, I no longer have any enemies." He stood up, seeming to flow to his feet in the weird way of the Wamphyri, and paced the floor to the window that looked out on the garden. Lardis followed him, watching as he opened thewindow, leaned out a little way, and inclined his head upwards to the misted mountain peaks. The ghost of a howl came ululating down, thin and eery, echoing in flooding moonlight. And behind his golden mask The Dweller smiled."No harm will come to me or mine," he eventually continued, when the howling stopped. "Shortly, even my most faithful will leave me; I shall ask them to leave, by which time they'll be ready.""But ... why do you isolate yourself?" Lardis was at pains to understand his motives. "Will you stay on here, alone?""Stay here? Ah, no. But I shall return from time to time, to talk to her, in my way ...""To your mother? When she is--""When she's dead, yes."For a moment Lardis believed he saw red fires reflected on the rims of the eye sockets in the golden mask, and he was hard put to contain a sudden shudder. Wamphyri, The Dweller, aye--and much more than that. For like his father before him he had ... ah, powers!The Dweller looked at Lardis, clasped his broad shoulders in pale thin hands, and thought: He's brave, this man. Brave and loyal. He should fear me, even run from me, but he stands his ground. Whatever comes to pass--however it shall be--I'll not hurt him or his. Never!It was as if Lardis heard him. All of the fear went out of him; a great deal of fear which, until the moment it left him, he'd scarcely realized was there at all. At least he'd never admitted it, not even to himself. Finally he straightened up and nodded. "Then it seems we have no more to talk about," he said. "Ah--except your father, of course."The Dweller's answering nod was thoughtful, deliberate. "How goes it with him?"Now Lardis gave a grunt and offered a frustrated shrug. "We care for him, feed him, watch over him in his fever," he answered. "Everything as you instructed--but we've no knowledge of his sickness. You say that both of you were burned by your own weapons, those brilliant beams of sunlight with which you destroyed the Wamphyri. Well, and your burns were plainly visible, Dweller, their effect immediate--it's a miracle you survived! But Harry Hell-lander was not burned, not that I ever saw."The Dweller had his answer ready. "I was burned on the outside," he said. "My flesh was physically scorched by the sun's fire. But my father's sickness is in his blood, a slow poison, like silver or kneblasch to the Wamphyri. It causes this fever in him. But when the fever has burned itself out, he will be cured. Then I'll take him back to his own place. And then at last I'll be alone here.""And that's what you want?""It's how it has to be." The Dweller's voice was now a low growl. He began to turn away--then swiftly turned back, face to face with the Gypsy. And urgently, perhaps pleadingly, he said: "Lardis, listen. I am Wamphyri! When I fought for this place, the fighting roused something up in me, in my blood. You trust me, I know. Likewise your people, and mine. But I don't know how long I may trust myself! Now do you understand?"Lardis believed he did, and a little of his escaped fear crept back in. "But how ... how will you survive?" Unintentionally, he placed some small emphasis on the word will.Before the other could answer, an echoing chorus of howls floated down out of the hills. With long, loping strides, The Dweller took himself back to the window, again inclining his head to the heights. And to Lardis he said, "How do they survive, the grey brotherhood?""They are hunters," the Gypsy answered, quietly. "And will you also ... hunt?""I know what you are thinking," The Dweller said. "And I don't blame you. Your times have been hard. The Wamphyri have made them so. But this I vow: I shall never hunt men."Lardis shivered again, but he believed The Dweller's words. "You are ... a changeling creature," he said. "I can't pretend to understand you.""A changeling, it's true," The Dweller agreed. "I had two fathers, only one of which was a man! My human flesh is dying now, but I can feel my vampire at work in me. He remembers his former host, and has other clay to mold."There was that in his voice ... Lardis was not afraid ... but there was weirdness in the air ... the moon had turned the garden yellow, with black mountains beyond, split by the deep blue V of the pass. "I should be going," the Gypsy said, his normal rumble of a voice little more than a whisper."See my hands," said The Dweller, "how thin they are, likepaws?" He stretched out his arms, until his hands and wrists stood free of the wide cuffs. "These I shall retain, as best I can--the hands of a man--to remind me of what I was." And cocking his head curiously on one side, he glanced at Lardis. "Also that you and your people shall know me, when I am ... other than I am now."Lardis looked; The Dweller's hands were pale and slim as a girl's; but his wrists and forearms, what could be seen of them, were grey-furred! Backing towards the door, the Gypsy hissed, "You, Dweller? A grey one?""When they call down from the peaks under the moon like that," the other sighed, "ah!--I hear them! And I know they call for me." He opened the door for Lardis, and the Gypsy tremblingly stepped out into the night."I ... I knew they were your friends, of course," he told The Dweller, where now that one stood framed in the doorway. "But--""My friends?" Again that quick tilt of The Dweller's head; his eyes, gleaming now in the eye-holes of his mask, no longer red but feral in moonlight. "That and more than that. My kin!"And as he turned more fully into the garden: "Lardis," The Dweller called after him. "Remember--we shall not hunt you. Be sure that you never hunt me or mine ..."Â <BR>Harry Keogh tossed and turned in tortured dreams. He had been tortured, a little. What his son, The Dweller, had done to him could not have been accomplished by any other means: the Necroscope's metaphysical mind had been entered like a house in the night, its innermost vaults penetrated, its owner deprived of his treasures. The intruder had been none other than Harry Jr. himself, called The Dweller, soon to be Harry Wolfson. Except he had stolen nothing, merely changed the combination on certain locks and booby-trapped certain passageways. During the course of work such as this, inevitably there had been some "structural" damage which, while he had kept it to a minimum, was the real cause of his father's "fever." It was not so much that Harry Keogh's blood was poisoned, rather that his mentality had been depleted.Harry dreamed of the forbidden Mobius Continuum. Trapped in its flux, he drifted useless as a ship with neither sail nor rudder, a waterlogged hulk rocked and slowly twirled by mathematicaltides and algebraic whirlpools, through straits of Pure Number where he was now innumerate. And in the primal darkness of that place beyond or between such places as men are allowed to know, he was aware of a thousand locked doors, all of them drifting with him, around him, even through him, each one of them a mystery to him, closed to him forever. For he was no longer empowered to conjure the Mobius equations which were their keys.They were doors, yes, to other places, even other times, but without their keys the immensity of the Möbius Continuum might as well be the narrow confines of a dungeon ... or the innermost chamber of some sunken Pharaonic tomb, lost forever in the Valley of the Kings.Such imaginative associations were cyclic and mutative as the stuff of dreams has ever been. Ideas evoked fresh visions as the focus of Harry's dream now shaped itself to this Egyptian motif. So that in the next moment he wondered: Doors? But if these myriad eerily drifting shapes are doors, then why do they look so much like sarcophagi?Sarcophagi, coffins, caskets: now they were made of glass, allowing him to see into them. And within, all of those teeming dead thousands, the Great Majority, could see out! They could see Harry drifting helplessly by, and soon commenced to shout at him. He saw their mouths working, death's-head jaws grimacing and snapping, the leather of mummied faces cracking where unnatural stress was applied to otherwise inanimate, exanimate tissues. They rapped on their glass lids with ivory knuckles, ogled him through empty sockets, waved X-ray hands as he went floating by.His countless dead friends: they talked to him as of old, questioned him, begged news, items of information, this, that or the other favour. But the ex-Necroscope couldn't hear them and in any case daren't listen, and he knew that he must never ever again try to answer them. Oh, Harry wasn't afraid of the dead and never had been, but he feared, indeed dreaded, their attempted communication with him! For his deadspeak talent had been forbidden to him, even as the most basic numbers were now unknowable. Worse, there would be a penalty to pay: such agony as might easily win him a box of his own!He could only offer them a negative shake of his head (and even then believed he took a risk) as he bobbed heavily along where once he'd skimmed, no longer master but captive of the MöbiusContinuum. I shouldn't even be here, he told himself. How did I get in here? How will I get out?As if some One had answered, he saw that the coffins were doors again, one of which opened directly in his path. Offering no resistance (he had none to offer), he was drawn through into another place, another time. Drawn into time itself, but time in reverse! And so Harry began to fall into his own past.Gathering speed, he was drawn backwards in time like a thread rewinding itself onto its bobbin. Indeed, he watched his own blue life-thread--nothing less than the course and continuity of his fourth-dimensional existence from birth to the grave--streaming back into him as he backtracked years already lived. And the thought occurred: I am going back to my beginnings. I will have it all to live--all to do, all to suffer--all over again!That was too much. It was the difference between a dream and a nightmare. And Harry Keogh woke up----Drenched in his own sweat, and gasping: "No!"Â <BR>"Don't!" she told him at once, her voice almost as startled and frightened as his own, but less hoarse. "You're hurting me.""Brenda!" Harry croaked, almost sobbed her name, while at the same time doubting that it was her name, but hoping anyway. Praying that it had all been a dream--and not just this part but all of it, everything--and a moment later knowing that it had not. No, for her fierce breasts, where now on impulse she suddenly hugged his face against them, weren't Brenda's; she didn't smell like Brenda; and anyway he remembered now that the Brenda he'd called out to had been many long years and an entirely different world ago."Brenda?" she repeated, her accent husky, Szgany, as he relaxed his grip on her arms and flopped back into his damp bed. "Were you dreaming, Harry Dwellersire?" She leaned over him, supported his head with a cool hand, stroked his brow."Dreaming?" He looked up at her, tried to focus on her. It wasn't easy; he felt weak as a kitten, drained. And that last word--coupled with what she'd called him, Dwellersire--was a trigger which released more memories. No, not drained, merely depleted. Robbed. By his own son, The Dweller. And none of it had been a dream, or only the last part. And even that had been so close to reality as to make no difference.He turned his head, looked around the small, stone-built,whitewashed, electric-lamplit room. A crude dwelling, little more than a cave. But luxury to some. Certainly to Travellers, who hadn't known what a permanent home was before The Dweller and his garden. And Harry's voice turned as sour as the fur lining his clammy mouth as he mumbled, "Starside?"She nodded. "Yes, Starside, the garden. And your fever has broken." She smiled at him. "You're going to be well again.""My ... fever?" His eyes went back to her face. It looked very lovely in the soft, uneven yellow flow of the lamplight; most of the electricity from The Dweller's generators went to the greenhouses. "Yes, my 'fever,'" Harry said again, nodding wryly. No fever, he knew. Just his shattered mind, gradually pulling its bits together again. "How long have I been lying here?""This is the second sundown," she told him. She withdrew her hand from under his head, replaced it with a bundled fur for a pillow. Then she stood up from her stool and said, "I'll prepare soup for you. After you have eaten, The Dweller will want to know that--""No!" he cut her short, his anxiety very tangible. "Not ... yet, a while. He doesn't need to know yet. I want a little time to myself, to get my thoughts in order."And she wondered: Is he afraid of his own son? Then perhaps we all should be.Harry looked at her standing there, a frown on her attractive if careworn face. She was small, amply proportioned, with dark eyes slightly aslant, a small nose for a Gypsy, and hair glossy black where it fell to her shoulders. Passionate as all her race--dressed in soft, supple leather--even motionless there was something animal, sinuous, sensual about her.Still frowning, she crossed to a fireplace built into the virgin rock of the innermost wall and hung a prepared pot from a tripod. Prodding the fire's embers to glowing life, and aware that Harry's eyes followed her every movement, she finally told him, "But The Dweller's instructions were very clear: Lardis's people are to tend your needs as best possible until such time as you recover, upon which--and immediately--he is to be informed.""My needs are that I'm not to be disturbed." Harry's wits were a little sharper now. "I'm not to be excited. You mustn't ... mustn't argue with me." All of this thinking, all of these words, were a big effort. Wearied, he lay back andwondered why he felt only half here. No, he knew why: it was because he was only half here. He had lost, been deprived of, several of his senses--like losing touch and taste. Which left him feeling numb, and life flavourless.The Gypsy woman smiled and slowly nodded, as if the sharpness of Harry's words had confirmed some unspoken thing. "You are wilful." She said what was on her mind. "All of you hell-landers are alike, wild and wilful. Zekintha, called Zek, and Jazz Simmons: they were the same. If only they had stayed here. Their hot blood--their children--would be welcome among the Travellers. We would be the stronger for it." It was a Szgany compliment."Szgany blood is hot enough," Harry answered, also a compliment. "So ... will you report my awakening? What's your name, anyway?""I am Nana Kiklu," she answered, coming back to sit beside him as before. "And no, I will not report your awakening. Not for a little while.""Not until morning? Sunup?"She cocked her head on one side. "That's a long time. We're only halfway into the night. There will be others looking after you before sunup, who will surely see that you are recovered.""Not if I'm asleep," Harry answered."Perhaps not ..." But now she could see how important this was to him, and so made up her mind. "Mine is the last shift," she said, thoughtfully. "If your recovery is still undiscovered when I return, then it can wait till daylight."Harry held back a sigh of relief, settled down more easily into his bed. He did actually need the time, didn't want to be transported back to his own world while he was still in ... in a state of shock? And so, "Fair enough," he said. And in open admiration: "Your man is fortunate, Nana Kiklu. At one and the same time, his woman is accommodating and charming.""I thank you," she answered at once, "but as for my man--alas, no." And now a certain longing, an emptiness, crept into her voice, and a sadness onto her face. For like Harry, Nana, too, had been deprived. "My man was ... less than fortunate," she explained. "In the battle for the garden, the Lord Belath's gauntlet, dipped in poison, sliced Hzak's shoulder to the bone. I prayed he would survive. He did survive--for six sunups."Now Harry Keogh sighed, more a groan than a sigh proper, and turned his face away; but not before she saw the sympathy living in it, and the regret. The time had been--but now was gone--when he might have contacted Hzak Kiklu to comfort him, tell him that the Wamphyri were no more. But ex-Necroscope, the dead were beyond Harry now."All things pass," she said, bravely. "Now--can you sit up? I have soup for you, with chunks of soft meat. Your blood has grown thin as water through all the hours you've lain here. This will thicken it up." She brought soup and bread. Harry was suddenly very tired, but he was hungry too. While he ate, Nana Kiklu looked on in silent approval. She approved of him wolfing the food she'd prepared, and she approved ... of him.Under his bedclothes lay the body of a hunter, a fighting man; hard-muscled as Hzak's had been, yet pale and different. Well, of course he was different, for he came out of the hell-lands of legend! But ... not that different. She'd washed him tip to toe and so knew he wasn't that different. But handsome, aye! Tall, and lean in the hip. Strong too, before his sickbed, and would be again. Nana had no concept of the word "athlete," but she could picture Harry chasing a wild pig and casting his spear: the ripple of his muscles, the narrowing of his strange honey-brown eyes. She could picture him doing ... many things.As for the waving grey streaks in the russet of his hair: it seemed unlikely that age could have put them there. Harry Dwellersire was--what, ageless? When she'd listened to him rambling in his fever, he had sounded like nothing so much as an innocent boy; for a fact his body seemed older than his mind! Nana couldn't know it, but in that last thought she had struck upon the absolute truth.So, why was he greying? Did it result from great learning, the wisdom that came from it, the weight of mighty knowledge? But knowledge of what strange things? In her reasoning, too, she came closer to the truth than she knew. But as things were she could only offer a small, unself-conscious shrug which went unnoticed. Why strive to understand anything? He was after all a hell-lander. It was probably as well that she neither knew nor understood.Harry was asleep almost before the last spoonful of soup was down, and a half hour later Nana Kiklu handed over her duties toanother, much older woman. Good as her word, she said nothing about their charge's partial recovery ...Â <BR>Harry woke up at the end of the six-hour shift, saw the old Gypsy woman nodding on her stool, closed his eyes and moaned until she started awake. Then he kicked his limbs, but feebly, convincing her that he was feverish still. When he calmed down she spooned soup into him, crooned to him until he slept again. Six hours later he employed the same subterfuge with a third Szgany woman, but this time there could be no hiding his rapid improvement. He was only saved by the prompt arrival of Nana Kiklu."He looks well," his unknown Gypsy nurse told Nana as she came in from Starside's long night, shrugging herself out of a heavy coat of fur. "His fever is in abeyance; all the clamminess has gone out of him; he took enough soup for two men! I think he'll wake soon. We should tell The Dweller."And feigning sleep, Harry heard Nana's answer."Let's not be too hasty. The Dweller is resting. Sunup is five hours away and the dawn will be time enough. Don't worry, I will see to it.""As you will," the other answered, and left.Harry had done most of his thinking in his sleep, which in the main had been restful; also in his dreams, which were less so. He was aware that his son would soon take him out of this world into his own and leave him there, and that he would be a free man again. But only a man, no more Necroscope, and no way round it. He wasn't reconciled to it but had no choice. For the time being, however, his frustration seemed all burned out of him; except ... he supposed it must return. Yes, as long as there were locked rooms in the mansion of his mind--while he remembered the Möbius Continuum, and the myriad dead friends who were lost to him now--it would always return.But looking at Nana Kiklu where she came to stand over him, looking at her through three-quarters-shuttered eyes, which yet feigned sleep, he found himself remembering other, more mundane things. Earthly, even earthy things; yet not of the earth, and certainly not of the grave. For Nana Kiklu was far from that. On the contrary, she was full of life. And he remembered how her breasts had felt against his face when she'd hugged him.And then he knew why he continued to feign sleep: so that he could watch her watching him. He wanted to consider her expression, and see if he could sense that in her which he felt in himself. It had been a long, long time since he'd known a woman.When Nana sat beside him he merged into her shadow, felt drawn to her. The top buttons of her soft leather blouse were open; leaning over him to straighten his pillow, the curves of her elastic breasts were partly exposed. Only lift his hands a little and he could test their weight. It was a struggle not to. And to control his breathing.She cocked her head a little on one side, half shuttered her own eyes, frowned at him. But her eyes, like her thoughts, were very deep. She had noticed the rise and fall of his chest: a trifle ... irregular? Both Harry and the Gypsy, each wondered what were the other's thoughts.In the same moment that he felt he must touch her, finally she moved, got up, went to the door--and barred it. And Harry knew, in the way people do, what was going to happen; also that he wanted it to happen.She came back, her Gypsy hips swaying hypnotically, and sat down again. But as she adjusted his blanket, so her hand crept beneath it onto his naked thigh. Harry stopped breathing, stiffened with the shock of her touch, and her suspicions were at once confirmed. Her laugh was low and husky. "I thought your fever had cooled a little. But look, here you are hot as ever! Hot--and hard ..."Already erect, his manhood grew more yet into her tightening, deliciously mobile fist, to hammer like a heart against her palm. Until he groaned, "No! Wait! Nana, don't waste me!" His trembling hands found the buttons of her blouse and her breasts tumbled free. While he fondled and kissed their softness, teasing her brown nipples to life, she struggled to be rid of her clothes and into bed with him."Fill me, Harry Dwellersire," she moaned, "for we've both been empty and aching for far too long. I'm not sure why you ache, but this may be part of the cure."He made no answer, found the sucking gate to her sex and drove into it. In the next moment, for a moment, he held himself back, then panted: "I can't--daren't--damn it, I'll get you pregnant!""No," she shook her head, rolled over on top and came downslow and heavy on him, trapping his flesh deep in her lava core and his face in the silky curtain of her hair. And slowly working her body, with her breasts lolling in his face, she gasped, "I'm ... barren." It was a lie; Hzak's seed had been at fault, she knew. But as for Nana, she wanted a child--so why not Harry's?Harry felt himself swelling, shook his head wildly. "Nana, I can't hold it!""Don't try," she told him, and instantly felt him jerking, geysering into her. His long bursts seemed unending, lubrication for the hot engine of her womanhood."Too quick," he moaned, angry with himself. "Too damn quick!""Yes," she murmured, smothering him in her breasts, her kisses. "Too quick. But that one was for you. This one will be for me, and it will be slower."It was. And so was the next ...Â <BR>In the grey twilight, just before sunup, Nana crept from Harry's bed and dressed, went to The Dweller and told him that his father's fever had broken. When she left her lover of a few brief hours, he was sleeping a dreamless, exhausted sleep, and somehow she knew it was the last she would see of him.But warm inside, she also knew it was not the last of his works.Copyright © 1992 by Brian Lumley

Harry Keogh, the first Necroscope, is arguably Brian Lumley's greatest creation. In the Necroscope series, readers saw Harry learn to use his powers to talk with the dead and travel instantaneously to any point in space and time. They saw him take arms against the evil, twisted, metamorphic alien vampires who sought to feed off humans and enslave mankind. They saw him suffer a great personal loss and then recover his family, and later his humanity, through a new love. And they saw Harry wage the grimmest battle of his life--against the vampire he himself was becoming!<BR><BR>Even after Harry's story was done, Brian Lumley continued to write books about Harry's legacy--the other Necroscopes who inherited his weird talents. But Harry himself would not go quietly into that darkness that lies beyond an author's imagination . . . and now Brian Lumley has written three new novellas about Harry and his supernatural adventures, which are published for the first time in the United States in Harry and the Pirates.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>BRIAN LUMLEY is the author of the Necroscope series--more than a dozen volumes strong--as well as the Titus Crow series, the Hero of Dreams series, and many other books of horror and dark fantasy.

In the chilling sequel to Necroscope: The Lost Years, Harry Keogh continues his desperate search for his missing wife and young son, who vanished during his epic struggle with the vampires who sought to control Keogh's powers.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>The epic battle between humanity and evil vampires and werewolves traced in Lumley's massive Necroscope novels continues in this second volume in the saga's Lost Years mini-saga, which began when Harry Keough, the Necroscope, lost his memory and awoke in the body of another man. Harry hasn't lost his powers to travel through time and space and to speak with the dead, however, so he's as potent an enemy as ever of vampires and werewolves. These creatures are the descendants of extraterrestrial exiles, and their struggle both to eliminate one another and to rule the world is reaching a climax. One of them, Radu Lykan, last of the original invaders and first of all werewolves, is seeking to move his mind from his own plague-ravaged body into Harry's. This premise leads to an absorbing, if convoluted and bloody tale. In the end, the Necroscope prevails with the aid of one of Radu's female accomplices, who has fallen in love with him, and with such odd allies from among the dead as Franz Anton Mesmer, Nostradamus and Harry Houdini. Lumley retains weaknesses for purple prose, maximum gore and discursive historical passages. Few readers who haven't followed the saga through the previous books will appreciate this volume, but those who have will know, and likely will relish, what they get. <BR>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>This latest book in the "Necroscope" series continues the story of battles against evil vampires. Harry Keogh, the Necroscope (a man who talks to dead people in their graves), searches for his missing wife and child. Purchase this horror book on demand.<BR>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>Ninth doorstopper volume in the Necroscope series, a towering vampire cycle and rousing sequel to 1995's Necroscope: The Lost Years (not reviewed). Volume two fills in the lost years of Earth's greatest vampire hunter, Harry Keogh, the Necroscope who can talk with the dead and teleport in space and time. When Keogh died and was reanimated in the body of brain-dead Alec Kyle, Harry's wife Brenda, unable to live with a total stranger, disappeared with their immensely powerful infant child. Three families of vampires banished to Earth from Starside, an alternate world, have been warring for millennia. Harry goes on leave from ESPionage, Britain's parapsychological intelligence group, to find his wife, but ESP hypnotically blocks his mind so that alien powers can't tap his hidden talents. It doesn't work: B.J. Mirlu, 200-year-old vampiress with whom Harry's in love, seizes control of his will, and, between B.J. and ESP, Harry loses large portions of his memory. During this lost period, a werewolf kills a rapist who's attacked a girl who works for B.J. at a bar B.J. owns in Edinburgh--an incident serving to reveal the plans of the two other vampire factions intent on destroying B.J. and those around her. The renewed vampire war couldn't come at a worse time: She and her moon-children guard the aerie where her master, the dog-Lord Radu, has been immersed in a vat of resin since the Black Plague, from which it's taken him 600 years to recover. Now his resurgence is at hand, and, if still infected, he'll move into Harry's body and rebuild it in his own image. B.J. is torn between her love for Harry and the possibility of her becoming a full-blown Wamphyri! But can Harry survive Radu's resurgence? Can the star-crossed B.J.? No diminution either of energy or of billowing High Purple prose. -- Copyright ©1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.

Lumley hasn't reached the heights of either originality or critical acclaim, but his consistent provision of honest entertainment for nearly 40 years makes him deserving of a volume like this.

Brian Lumley's Necroscope novels are one of the horror genre's most towering achievements. They chronicle the adventures of Necroscope, Harry Keogh, his successor, Jake Cutter, and the psychically gifted agents of E-Branch, Britain's super-secret spy organization, and their battles against the malevolent, shape-shifting Wamphyri and their spawn. Their exploits have spanned two worlds, thirteen novels, and an infinity of time. The Necroscope novels have sold more than two million copies in English alone. <BR><BR>Tor Books is proud to publish Necroscope: Deadspeak in hardcover for the first time. Previously available only as a mass market, paperback Necroscope: Deadspeak is the fourth volume in Lumley's exciting vampire series, and marks the beginning of a new phase in the story of the Necroscope.<BR><BR>Harry Keogh has triumphed over much adversity in his life, from the death of his mother and the discovery of his amazing powers-to talk to the dead and to travel instantaneously to any place via the Möbius Continuum-to the fallout from his war against the vampires. He lost his body, though not his life; his wife and infant son disappeared without a trace; and he had to kill a woman he had come to love. What should have been a joyful reunion with his son was tinged with horror when Harry realized that his boy-now a man-was half-Necroscope and half-vampire, and thus a deadly double threat to all mankind. <BR>Father faced son in a terrible battle, and when it was over, Harry awoke safe in his own bed, at home . . . but his Necroscope powers were gone, locked away in the depths of his mind! <BR>Now, a new evil rears its head in the Balkan Mountains. Janos Ferenczy, master vampire and black magician, has risen from an ages-long sleep. As the first step in his plans of conquest, he conjures dead men and women into a perverse semblance of life and subjects them to fiendish tortures. But the shrieks of the dead barely begin to satisfy Janos's bloodlusts as he prepares an army of undead warriors to conquer the world. <BR><BR>The dead try desperately to attract the Necroscope's attention, but Harry Keogh is deaf to their pleas and their screams. As Harry searches for a cure, he learns that to save mankind he must ally himself with the crafty father of vampires, the infamous Faethor Ferenczy. Centuries dead, Faethor lies in his grave and schemes. He will help Harry defeat Janos-but his price will be very high indeed!<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>First published as a paperback original in 1990, this fourth volume in British author Lumley's popular series pays particular homage to Bram Stoker's Dracula, featuring a multinational team of vampire hunters who rely on the latest technology to scour Europe to foil a master vampire's plans to move his nest and expand his troop of thralls. The hunt's conclusion takes Harry Keogh, the "Necroscope" (one who speaks to the dead), into misty Transylvania, where he fights the resurrected Janos Ferenczy in his ruined castle for possession of his lady love, Sandra. Lumley retains much of the florid melodrama that Stoker reveled in, with an increased explicitness suited to the present day. Still, the traditions are there: vampires can change form, are vulnerable to silver and garlic and must receive permission before entering either a dwelling or a mind. Lumley provides more rationale than Stoker, and he also secularizes the legend, toning down the original's Christian aversion to "blasphemous" dialogue. Lumley also broadens the scope, adding much to the story of psychic abilities, centered on the ultra-secret "E-Branch (`E' for ESP)" division of Britain's Secret Service. With their paranormal powers, Harry's E-Branch teammates give the novel an Ian Fleming/Stephen King crossover feel. Despite a tendency to overreach his descriptive power and the dated Cold War background, Lumley (Psychomech) tells a fast-moving tale of the primal horror of an undead parasite worthy of Stoker's original. <BR><BR>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc. <BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Like the vampires it so full-bloodedly portrays, Brian Lumley's Necroscope series just gets stronger.

All rights reserved.<BR>NECROSCOPE IV: DEADSPEAK<BR>One: NecroscopeCHRISTENED HARRY "SNAITH," IN EDINBURGH, 1957, Harry is the son of a psychic-sensitive mother, Mary Keogh (who is herself the daughter of a "gifted" expatriate Russian lady), and Gerald Snaith, a banker. Harry's father dies of a stroke the following year, and in the winter of 1960 his mother marries again, this time choosing for a husband a Russian by the name of Viktor Shukshin. Like Mary's mother before him, Shukshin has fled the USSR, a supposed "dissident," which perhaps accounts for Mary's initial attraction to him in what will soon become an unmitigated mismatch.Winter of 1963: Harry's mother is murdered by Shukshin at Bonnyrig outside Edinburgh, where he drowns her under the ice of a frozen river. He alleges that, while skating, she crashed through a thin crust and was washed away; there was nothing he could do to save her; he is "distraught, almost out of [his] mind with grief and horror." Mary Keogh's body is never found; Shukshin inherits her isolated Bonnyrig house and the not inconsiderable monies left to her by her first husband.Within six months the infant Harry (now Harry "Keogh") has gone to live with an uncle and his wife at Harden on the northeast coast of England. The arrangement is more than satisfactory to Shukshin, who could never stand the child.Harry commences schooling with the roughneck children of the colliery village. A dreamy, introspective sort of child, he is a loner, develops few friendships (with fellow pupils, at any rate), and thus falls easy prey to bullying and the like. And as he grows towards his teens, so his daydreaming spirit, psychic insight, and instincts lead him into further conflict with his teachers. But he is not lacking in grit--on the contrary.Harry's problem is that he has inherited his maternal forebears' mediumistic talents, and that they are developed (and still developing) in him to an extraordinary degree. He has no requirement for "real" friends as such, because the many friends he already has are more than sufficient and willing to supply his needs. As to who these friends are: they are the myriad dead in their graves!Up against the school bully, Harry defeats him with the telepathic assistance of an ex-ex-army physical training instructor; a man who, before the fall from sea cliffs which killed him, was expert in many areas of self-defence. Punished with mathematical homework, Harry receives help from an ex-headmaster of the school; but in this he almost gives himself away. His current maths teacher is the son of Harry's coach, where he lies "at rest" in Harden Cemetery, and as such he very nearly recognises his father's hand in Harry's work.In 1969 Harry passes examinations to gain entry into a technical college at West Hartlepool a few miles down the coast, and in the course of the next five years until the end of his formal (and orthodox) education, does his best to tone down use of his talents and extraordinary skills in an attempt to prove himself a "normal, average student"--except in one field. Knowing that he will soon need to support himself, he has taken to writing; even by the time he finishes school he has seen several short pieces of fiction in print. His tutor isa man once moderately famous for his vivid short stories--who has been dead since 1947. But this is just the beginning; under a pseudonym and before he is nineteen, Harry has already written his first full-length novel, Diary of a Seventeenth-Century Rake. While falling short of the bestseller lists, still the book does very well. It is not so much a sensation for its storyline as for its amazing historical authenticity ... until one considers the qualifications of Harry's co-author and collaborator: namely, a seventeenth-century rake, shot dead by an outraged husband in 1672!Summer of 1976. In a few months Harry will be nineteen. He has his own unassuming top-floor flat in an old three-story house on the coast road out of Hartlepool towards Sunderland. Perhaps typically, the house stands opposite one of the town's oldest graveyards ... Harry is never short of friends to talk to. What's more, and now that his talent as a Necroscope has developed to its full, he can converse with exanimate persons even over great distances. He needs only to be introduced or to have spoken to one of the teeming dead, and thereafter can always seek him out again. With Harry, however, it's a matter of common decency that he physically go and see them: that is, to attend them at their grave sides. He does not believe in "shouting" at his friends.In their turn (and in return for his friendship) Harry's dead people love him. He is their pharos, the one shining light in their eternal darkness. He brings hope where none has ever before existed; he is their single window, their observatory on a world they had thought left behind and gone forever. For contrary to the beliefs of the living, death is not The End but a transition to incorporeality, immobility. The flesh may be weak and corruptible, but mind and will go on. Great artists, when they die, continue to visualise magnificent canvases, pictures they can never paint; architects plan fantastic, faultless, continent-spanning cities, which can never be built; scientists follow through the research they commenced in life but never had time to complete or perfect. Except that now, through Harry Keogh, they may contact one another and (perhaps more importantly) even obtain knowledge of thecorporeal world. And so, while they would never deliberately burden him, all the trials and tribulations of Harry's countless dead friends are his, and his troubles are theirs. And Harry does have troubles.At his flat in Hartlepool, when he is not working, Harry entertains his childhood sweetheart, Brenda, who will shortly fall pregnant and become his wife. But as his worldly scope widens, so a shadow from the past grows into an obsession. Harry dreams and daydreams of his poor murdered mother, and time and again in his darkest nightmares revisits the frozen river where she died before her time. Finally he resolves to take revenge on Viktor Shukshin, his stepfather.In this, as in all things, he has the blessing of the dead. Murder is a crime they cannot tolerate; knowing the darkness of death, anyone who deliberately takes life is an abhorrence to them!Winter of 1976 and Harry goes to see Shukshin, confronting him with evidence of his guilt. His stepfather is plainly dangerous, even deranged, and Harry suspects he'll now try to kill him, too. In January of '77 he gives him the opportunity. They skate on the river together, but when Shukshin moves in for the kill, Harry is prepared. His plan goes wrong, however; they both fall through the ice and emerge together by the riverbank. The Russian has the strength of a madman and will surely drown his stepson ... But no, for Harry's mother rises from her watery grave to drag Shukshin down!And Harry has discovered a new talent; or rather, he now knows how far the dead will go in order to protect him--knows that in fact they will rise from their graves for him!Â <BR>Harry's talent has not gone unnoticed: a top-secret British intelligence organization, E-Branch ("E" for ESP), and its Soviet counterpart are both aware of his powers. He is no sooner approached to join the British organization than its head is killed, taken out by the Romanian spy and necromancer Boris Dragosani. A ghoul, Dragosani rips open the dead to steal their secrets right out of their blood and guts;by butchering the top man in E-Branch, he now knows all the secrets of the British espers.Harry vows to track him down and even the score, and the teeming dead offer their assistance. Of course they do, for even they are not safe from a man who violates corpses! What Harry and the dead don't know is that Dragosani has been infected with vampirism: he has the vampire egg of Thibor Ferenczy inside him, growing there, gradually changing him and taking control. More, Dragosani has murdered a colleague, Max Batu the Mongol, in order to steal the secret of his killing eye. He can now kill at a glance!Time is short and Harry must follow Dragosani back to the USSR--to Soviet E-Branch headquarters at the Chateau Bronnitsy, where the vampire is now Supremo--and there kill him. But how? Harry is no spy.A British precog (an agent with the ability to scan vague details of the future) has foreseen Harry's involvement not only with vampires but also in connection with the twisted figure-8 sigil of the Möbius strip. To get to Dragosani he must first understand the Möbius connection. Here at least Harry is on familiar ground; for August Ferdinand Möbius has been dead since 1868, and the dead will do anything for Harry Keogh.In Leipzig Harry visits Möbius's grave and discovers the long-expired mathematician and astronomer at work on his space-time equations. What he did in life he continues, undisturbed, to do in death; and in the course of a century he has reduced the physical universe to a set of mathematical symbols. He knows how to bend space-time and ride his Möbius strip out to the stars! Teleportation: an easy route into the Chateau Bronnitsy--or anywhere else, for that matter. Fine, but all Harry has is an intuitive grasp of maths--and he certainly doesn't have a hundred years! Still, he has to start somewhere.For days Möbius instructs Harry, until his pupil is sure that the answer lies right here, just an inch beyond his grasp. He only needs a spur, and ...The East German GREPO (Grenz Polizei) have their eyeon Harry. On the orders of Dragosani they try to arrest him in the Leipzig graveyard--and this is the spur he needs. Suddenly Möbius's equations are no longer meaningless figures and symbols: they are a doorway into the strange immaterial universe of the Möbius Continuum! Harry conjures a Möbius door and escapes from the GREPO trap; by trial and error he learns how to use this weird and until now entirely conjectural parallel universe; eventually he projects himself into the grounds of Soviet E-Branch HQ.Against the armoured might of the Chateau Bronnitsy, Harry's task seems nigh impossible: he needs allies. And he finds them. The chateau's grounds are waterlogged, peaty, white under the crisp snow of a Russian winter--but not frozen. And down in the peat, preserved through four centuries since a time when Moscow was sacked by a band of Crimean Tartars, the remains of that butchered band stir and begin to rise up!With his zombie army Harry advances into the chateau, destroys its defences, seeks out and kills Dragosani and his vampire tenant. In the fight he, too, is killed; his body dies; but in the last moment his mind, his will, transfers to the metaphysical Möbius Continuum.And riding the Möbius strip into future time, Harry's id is absorbed into the unformed infant mentality ... of his own son!I: Castle FerenczyTRANSYLVANIA, THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 1981 ...Still an hour short of midday, two peasant wives of Halmagiu village wended their way home along well-trodden forest tracks. Their baskets were full of small wild plums and the first ripe berries of the season, all with the dew still glistening on them. Some of the plums were still a little green ... all the better for the making of sharp, tangy brandy! Dark-robed, with coarse rioth headsquares framing their narrow faces, the women cheerfully embroidered tidbits of village gossip to suit their mood, their teeth flashing ivory in weathered leather as they laughed over especially juicy morsels.In the near distance, blue wood smoke drifted in almost perpendicular spirals from Halmagiu's chimneys; it formed a haze high over the early-autumn canopy of forest. But closer, in the trees themselves were other fires; cooking smells of spiced meats and herbal soups drifted on the still air; small silver bells jingled; a bough creaked where a wild-haired,dark-eyed, silent, staring child dangled from the rope of a makeshift swing.There were gaudy caravans gathered in a circle under the trees. Outside the circle: tethered ponies cropped the grass, and bright-coloured dresses swirled where bare-armed girls gathered firewood. Inside: black iron cooking pots suspended over licking flames issued puffs of mouth-watering steam; male Travellers tended their own duties or simply looked on, smoking their long, thin-stemmed pipes, as the encampment settled in. Travellers, yes. Wanderers: Gypsies! The Szgany had returned to the region of Halmagiu.The boy on the rope in the tree had spotted the two village women and now uttered a piercing whistle. All murmur and jingle and movement in the Gypsy encampment ceased upon the instant; dark eyes turned outwards in unison, staring with curiosity at the Romanian peasant women with their baskets. The Gypsy men in their leather jackets looked very strong, somehow fierce, but there was nothing of animosity in their eyes. They had their own codes, the Szgany, and knew which side their bread was greased. For five hundred years the people of Halmagiu had dealt with them fairly, bought their trinkets and knickknacks, and left them in peace. And so in their turn the Gypsies would work no deliberate harm against Halmagiu."Good morning, ladies." The Gypsy king (for so the leaders of these roving bands prided themselves, as little kings) stood up on the steps of his wagon and bowed to them. "Please tell our friends in the village we'll be knocking on their doors--pots and pans of the best quality, charms to keep away the night things, cards to read, and keen eyes that know the lie of a line in your palm. Bring out your knives for sharpening and your broken ax handles. All will be put to rights. Why, this year we've even a good pony or two, to replace the nags that pull your carts! We'll not be here long, so make the best of our bargains before we move on.""Good morning to you," the oldest of the pair at once answered, if in a breathless fashion. "And be sure I'll tellthem in the village." And in a hushed aside to her companion: "Stay close; move along with me; say nothing!"As they passed by one of the wagons, so this same older woman took a small jar of hazelnuts from her basket and a double handful of plums, placing them on the steps of the wagon as a gift. If the offering was seen, no one said anything, and in any case the activity in the camp had already resumed its normal pace as the women headed once more for home.But the younger one, who hadn't lived in Halmagiu very long, asked, "Why did you give the nuts and plums away? I've heard the Gypsies give nothing for nothing, do nothing for nothing, and far too often take something for nothing! Won't it encourage them, leaving gifts like that?""It does no harm to keep well in with the fey people," the other told her. "When you've lived here as long as I have, you'll know what I mean. And anyway, they're not here to steal or work mischief." She gave a small shudder. "Indeed, I fancy I know well enough why they're here.""Oh?" said her friend wonderingly."Oh, yes. It's the phase of the moon, a calling they've heard, an offering they'll make. They propitiate the earth, replenish the rich soil, appease ... their gods.""Their gods? Are they heathens, then ... ? What gods?""Call it Nature if you like!" the first one snapped. "But ask me no more. I'm a simple woman and don't wish to know. Nor should you wish to know. My grandmother's grandmother remembered a time when the Gypsies came. Aye, and likely her granny before her. Sometimes fifteen months will go by, or eighteen--but never more than twenty-one--before they're back again. Spring, summer, winter: only the Szgany themselves know the season, the month, the time. But when they hear the calling, when the moon is right, when a lone wolf howls high up in the mountains, then they return. Yes, and when they go, they always leave their offering ...""What sort of offering?" The younger woman was more curious than ever."Don't ask," said the other, hurriedly shaking her head."Don't ask." But it was only her way; the younger woman knew she was dying to tell her; she bided her time and resolved to ask no more.But in a little while, fancying that they'd strayed too far from the most direct route back to the village, she felt obliged to enquire, "But isn't this a long way round we're taking?""Be quiet now!" hushed the older woman. "Look!"They had arrived at a clearing in the forest at the foot of a gaunt outcrop of grey volcanic rock. Bald and domed, with several humps, this irregular mound stood perhaps fifty feet high, with more forest beyond, then sheer cliffs rising to a fir-clad plateau like a first gigantic step to the misted, grimly forbidding heights of the Zarundului massif. The trees around the base of the outcrop had been felled, all shrubs and undergrowth cleared away; at its summit, a cairn of heavy stones stood like a small tower or chimney, pointing to the mountains.And up there, seated on the bare rock at the foot of the cairn, working with a knife at a shard of stone which he held in his lap--a young man: Szgany! He was intent upon his work, seeing nothing but the stone in his hands. He gazed down across a distance of little more than one hundred feet--gazed seemingly head-on, so that the women of the village must surely be central to his periphery of vision--but if he saw them he gave no sign. And indeed it was plain that he did not see them, only the stone which he worked. And even at that distance, clearly there was something ... not quite right with him."But ... what's he doing up there?" the younger of the two enquired in a hoarse whisper. "He's very handsome, and yet ... strange. And anyway, isn't this a forbidden place? My Hzak tells me that the great stone of the cairn is a very special stone, and that--""Shhh!" the other once again cautioned her, a finger to her lips. "Don't disturb him. They don't take kindly to being spied upon, the Szgany. Not that this one will hear us anyway. Still ... best to be careful.""He won't hear us, you say? Then why are we talking inwhispers? No, I know why we're whispering: because this is a private place, like a shrine. Almost holy.""Unholy!" the other corrected her. "As to why he won't notice us--why, just look at him up there! His skin's not so much dark as slate grey, sickly, dying. Eyes deep-sunken, burning. Obsessed with that stone he's carving. He's been called, can't you see? He's mazed, hypnotised--doomed!"Even as the last word left her lips, so the man on the rock stood up, took up his stone, and ground it firmly into position on the rim of the cairn. It sat there side by side with many dozens of others, like a brick in the topmost tier of a wall, and anyone having seen the ritual of the carving would know that each single stone of that cairn was marked in some weird, meaningful way. The younger woman opened her mouth to say something, but her friend at once anticipated her question."His name," she said. "He carved his name and his dates, if he knows them. Like all the other names and dates carved up there. Like all the others gone before him. That rude stone is his headstone, which makes the cairn itself a graveyard!"Now the young Gypsy was craning his neck, looking up, up at the mountains. He stood frozen in that position for long moments, as if waiting for something. And high in the grey-blue sky a small dark blot of cloud drifted across the face of the sun. At that, the elder of the two women gave a start; she herself had become almost hypnotised, stalled there and without the will to move on. But as the sun was eclipsed and shadows fell everywhere, she grabbed the other's elbow and turned her face away. "Come," she gasped, suddenly breathless, "let's be gone from here. Our men will be worried. Especially if they know there are Gypsies about."They hurried through the shadows of the trees, found the track, soon began to see the first wooden houses on Halmagiu's outskirts, where the forest thinned down to nothing. But even as they stepped out from the trees into a dusty lane and their heartbeats slowed a little, so they heard a sound from behind and above and far, far beyond.Not quite midday in Halmagiu, the sun coming out frombehind a small, stray cloud; the first days of true winter still some seven or eight weeks away--but every soul who heard that sound took it as a wintry omen anyway. Aye, and some took it for more than that.It was the mournful voice of a wolf echoing down from the mountains, calling as wolves have called for a thousand, thousand years and more. The two women paused, clutched their baskets, held their breath and listened. But:"There's no answering cry," said the younger eventually. "He's alone, that old wolf.""For now." The other nodded. "Aye, alone--but he's been heard all right, take my word for it. And he will be answered, soon enough. Following which ..." She shook her head and hurried on.The other caught up with her. "Yes, following which?" she pressed.The older woman peered at her, scowled a little, finally barked, "But you must learn to listen, Anna! There are some things we don't much talk about up here--so if you want to learn, then when they are talked about, you must listen!""I was listening," the other answered. "It's just that I didn't understand, that's all. You said the old wolf would be answered, soon enough. And ... and then?""Aye, and then," said the older one, turning towards her doorway, where bunches of garlic dangled from the lintel, drying in the sun. And over her shoulder: "And then--the very next morning--why, the Szgany will be gone! No trace of them at all except maybe the ashes in their camp, the ruts in the tracks where their caravans have rolled, moving on. But their numbers will have been shortened by one. One who answered an ancient call and stayed behind."The younger woman's mouth formed a silent "O.""That's right," said the first, nodding. "You just saw him--adding his soul to those other poor souls inscribed in the cairn on the rock ..."Â <BR>That night, in the Szgany camp:The girls danced, whirling to the skirl of frenzied violinsand the primal thump and jingle of tambourines. A long table stood heavy with food: joints of rabbit and whole hedgehogs, still steaming from the heat of the trenches where they'd baked; wild-boar sausages, sliced thin; cheeses purchased or bartered in Halmagiu village; fruit and nuts; onions simmering in gravy poured from the meats; Gypsy wines and sharp, throat-clutching wild-plum brandy.There was a festival atmosphere. The flames of a central fire, inspired by the music, leaped high and the dancers were sinuous, sensuous. Alcohol was consumed in large measure; some of the younger Gypsies drank from a sense of relief, others from fear of an uncertain future. For those who had been spared this time around, there would always be other times ...But they were Szgany and this was the way of things; they were His to the ends of the earth, His to command, His to take. Their pact with the Old One had been signed and sealed more than four hundred years ago. Through Him they had prospered down the centuries, they prospered now, they would prosper in all the years to come. He made the hard times easier--aye, and the easy times hard--but always He achieved a balance. His blood was in them, and theirs in Him. And the blood is the life.Only two amongst them were alone and private. Even with the girls dancing, the drinking, the feasting, still they were alone. For all of this noise and movement around them was an assumed gaity, wherein they could scarcely participate.One of them, the young man from the cairn, sat on the steps of an ornately carved and painted wagon, with a whetstone and his long-bladed knife, bringing the cutting edge to a scintillant shimmer of silver in the flicker of near-distant firelight. While in the yellow camplight behind him where the door stood open, his mother sat sobbing, wringing her hands, praying for all she was worth to One who was not a god--indeed, to One who was the very opposite--that He spare her son this night. But praying in vain.And as one tune ended and bright skirts whispered to a halt, falling about gleaming brown limbs, and mustached menquit their leaping and high-kicking--in that interval when the fiddlers sipped their brandy before starting up again--then the moon showed its rim above the mountains, whose misted crags were brought to a sudden prominence. And as mouths gaped open and all eyes turned upwards to the risen moon, so the mournful howl of a wolf drifted down to them from unseen aeries of rock.For a single moment the tableau stood frozen ... but the next saw dark eyes turning to gaze at the young man on the caravan steps. He stood up, looked up at the moon and the crags, and sighed. And sheathing his knife, he stepped down to the clearing, crossed it on wooden legs, headed for the darkness beyond the encircling wagons.His mother broke the silence. Her wail, rising to a shriek of anguish, was that of a banshee as she hurled herself from their caravan home, crashed down the wooden steps, came reeling after her son, her arms outstretched. But she did not go to him; instead she fell to her knees some paces away, her arms still reaching, aching for him. For the chief of this band, their "king," had stepped forward to embrace the young man. He hugged him, kissed him on both cheeks, released him. And without more ado the chosen one went out of the firelight, between the wagons, and was swallowed by darkness."Dumitru!" his mother screamed. She got to her feet, made to rush after him--and flew into the arms of her king."Peace, woman," he told her gruffly, his throat bobbing. "We've seen it coming a month now, watched the change in him. The Old One has called and Dumitru answers. We knew what to expect. This is always the way of it.""But he's my son, my son!" she sobbed wrackingly into his chest.""Aye," he said, his own voice finally breaking, sending tears coursing down his leathery cheeks. "And mine ... mine too ... aye."He led her stumbling and sobbing back to their caravan, and behind them the music started up again, and the dancing, and the feasting and drinking ...Â <BR>Â <BR>Dumitru Zirra climbed the ramparts of the Zarundului like a fox born to those heights. The moon lit a path for him, but even without that silver swath he would have known the way. For there was guidance from within: a voice inside his head, which was not his voice, told him where to step, reach, grasp. There were paths up here, if you knew them, but between these hairpin tracks were vertiginous shortcuts. Dumitru chose the latter, or someone made that choice for him.Dumiitruuu! the dark voice crooned to him, drawing out his name like a cry of torment. Ah, my faithful, my Szgaaany, son of my sons. Step here, and there, and here, Dumiitruuu. And here, where the wolf stepped--see his mark on the rock? The father of your fathers awaits you, Dumiitruuu. The moon is risen up and the hour draws niiigh. Make haste, my son, for I'm old and dry and shrivelled close to death--the true death! But you shall succor me, Dumiitruuu. Aye, and all your youth and strength be miiine!Almost to the treeline the youth laboured, his breath ragged and his hands bloody from the climbing, to the blackest crags of all, where a vast ruin humped against the final cliff. On the one side a gorge so sheer and black it might descend to hell, and on the other the last of the tall firs shielding the tumbled pile of some ancient keep, set back against sheer-rising walls of rock. Dumitru saw the place and for a moment was brought up short, but then he also saw the flame-eyed wolf standing in the broken gates of the ruin and hesitated no more. He went on, and the great wolf led the way.Welcome to my house, Dumiitruuu! that glutinous voice oozed like mud in his mind. You are my guest, my son ... enter of your own free will ...Dumitru Zirra clambered dazedly over the first shattered stones of the place, and mazed as he was, still the queer aspect of these ruins impressed him. It had been a castle, of that he was sure. In olden times a boyar had lived here, a Perenczy--Janos Ferenczy! No question of that, for down all the ages since the time of Grigor Zirra, the first Szgany "king," the Zirras had been sworn in allegiance to the BaronFerenczy and had borne his crest: a bat leaping into flight from the mouth of a black urn, with wings outspread, showing three ribs to each wing. The eyes of the bat were red, likewise the ribs of its wings, made prominent in scarlet, while the vessel from which it soared was in the shape of a burial urn.Aye, and now the youth's deep-sunken, staring eyes picked out a like design carved on the shattered slab of a huge stone lintel where it lay half-buried in debris; and indeed he knew that he stood upon the threshold of the great and ancient patron of the Zirras and their followers. For it was that same sigil as described which even now was displayed on the sides of Vasile Zirra's caravan (however cleverly obscured in the generally ornate and much-convoluted lacquer and paintwork designs). Similarly old Vasile, Dumitru's father, wore a ring bearing a miniature of this crest, allegedly passed down to him from time immemorial. This would have been Dumitru's one day--had he not heard the calling ...Some little way ahead of Dumitru the great wolf growled low in its throat, urging him on. He paused, however, uncertain where the shadows of fallen blocks obscured his vision. The front edge of the ruin seemed to have been tossed (tossed, yes, as by some enormous explosion in the guts of the place) out to and beyond the rim of the gorge, where still a jumble of massive stones and slates were spread in dark confusion, so that Dumitru supposed a large part of the castle had gone down into the gorge.As to what could have caused such destruction, he had no--But you hesitate, my son, came that monstrous mental voice, oozing like a slug in his mind, overriding and obliterating all matters of question and conjecture and will. That voice which had completely overwhelmed and taken control of him during the course of the last four or five weeks, making him its zombie. And I see that it is as I suspected, Dumiitruuu ... you are strong-willed! Good! Very good! The strength of the will is that of the body, and the strength ofthe body is the blood. Your blood is strong, my son, as it is in all your race ...The great wolf growled again and Dumitru stumbled after. The youth knew he should flee this place, run headlong, break his bones in the dark and crawl if he must--anything but carry on. And yet he was powerless against the lure of that ancient, evil voice. It was as if he had made some promise he could not break, or as if he kept the promise of some long-dead and honoured ancestor, which was inviolable.Now, guided by the voice in his head, he stumbled among leaning menhir blocks in search of a certain spot; now he went on all fours, clearing away fresh-fallen leaves, damp grey lichens, and shards of black rock; now he discovered (or merely uncovered, for the voice had told him it would be here) a narrow slab with an iron ring, which he lifted easily. A blast of foul air struck his face, filled his lungs, made him more dizzy yet where he crouched over the black and reeking abyss; and when at last his head cleared--of the fumes, at least--he was already descending into nightmare depths.Now the voice told him: Here, here my son ... a niche in the wall ... torches, a bundle, and matches all wrapped in a skin ... aye, better than the flints of my youth ... light one torch and take two more with you ... for be sure you'll need them, Dumiitruuu ...The stone stairwell spiralled; Dumitru descended nitrous steps, obliged to clamber in places where the stair had collapsed. He reached a buckled floor littered with blocks of fire-blackened masonry; another trapdoor; the descent continued through dankly echoing bowels of earth. Down, ever down, to sinister and sentient nether pits ...Until at last:Well done, Dumiitruuu, the dark voice complimented him--a voice that smiled monstrously, invisibly, whose owner was well pleased with himself--his pleasure grating like a file on the nerve-endings of the young man's brain. And suddenly ... Dumitru might have bolted. For a split second he was his own man again--he knew he stood on the very threshold of hell!But then that alien intelligence closed like a vise on his mind; the inexorable process started five weeks ago guided him towards its logical conclusion; the strength of free will flickered like a guttering candle in him, almost extinguished. And ...Look about you, Dumiitruuu. Look and learn what are the works and mysteries of your master, my son ...Behind Dumitru on the stone staircase, the great flame-eyed wolf. And before him--The lair of a necromancer!Such things were legends amongst the Szgany, tales to be told about the campfires in certain seasons, but neither Dumitru nor any other who might view this scene would require any special knowledge or explanation save that of his own imagination, his own instinct. And wide-eyed and gape-mouthed, with his torch held high, the youth wandered unsteadily through the ordered remnants and relics of chaos and madness.Not the chaos of the upper regions, which was purely physical, for these secret nether vaults had suffered little of the destruction of the higher levels; they were preserved, pristine under the dust and cobwebs of half a century. No, this was a mental chaos: the knowledge that these were the works of a man or men--or, again taking into account all manner of Szgany myth and legend, the works of things disguised as such.Of the vaults themselves:The stonework was ancient, indeed hoary. Nitre-streaked and yet not noticeably damp, in places the masonry even showed signs of dripstone concretion. Wispy stalactite strings depended from the high-vaulted ceilings; and around the edges of the rooms, where the floor had been not so frequently trodden, smooth-domed stalagmite deposits formed small nodes or blisters on the roughly fitted flags. Dumitru was no archaeologist, but from the primitive roughness of the dressed stone and the poor condition of the ancient mortar alone, even he would have dated the castle--or at least these secret regions of the castle--as being some eight or nine hundredyears old. It would need to be at least that for the formation of these calcium deposits--or else the solutions seeping from above must be heavily laced with crystalline salts.There were numerous archways, uniformly eight feet wide and eleven high, all wedged at their tops with massive keystones, some of which had settled a little from the unimaginable tonnage of the higher levels. The ceilings--none of them less than fourteen or fifteen feet tall at apex--were vaulted in an interlocking design similar to the archways; in several places massive blocks had fallen, doubtless shaken loose by whatever blast had doomed the place, shattering the heavy flags of the floor like schoolroom slates.Beyond the archways were rooms all of a large size, all with archways of their own; Dumitru had descended to a maze of ancient rooms, where the tenant of this broken pile had practised his secret arts. As to the nature of those arts:So far, with the single exception of his first terrified guess, Dumitru had avoided conjecture. But this was no longer possible. The walls were covered in frescoes which, however faded, told the entire tale; and many of the rooms contained undeniable evidence of a much more solid, much more frightening nature. Also, the voice in his head, now cruel and full of glee, would not permit of his ignorance: it desired that he know the way of these old matters.Necromancy, you thought, Dumitru, when first your torch cast back the shadows down here, the voice reiterated. The resurrection of defunct salts and ashes back into life for the purpose of interrogation. The history of the world, as it were, from the horse's mouth, from the reanimated, imperfect wraiths of them that lived it. The unravelling of ancient secrets, and perhaps even the foretelling of the dimly distant future. Aye, divination by use of the dead ... ! That is what you thought.Well, (and after a small pause the voice gave a mental shrug) and you were right--as far as you went. But you did not go far enough. You have avoided looking ... you avoid it even now! What, and are you my son, Dumitru, or somepuling babe in arms? I thought I had called strong wine in unto myself, only to discover that the Szgaaany have been brewing water all these years! Ha-haa-haaa! But no ... I make jokes ... don't be so angry, my ,son ...... It is anger, is it not, Dumiitruuu? No?Fear, perhaps?You fear for your life, Dumiitruuu? The voice had sunk to a whisper now, but insidious as the drip of a slow acid. But you shall have your life, my son--in me! The blood is the life, Dumiitruuu--and that shall go on and on ... aaand ...But there! Now the voice sprang alive, became merry. Why, we were grown morose, and that must never be! What? But we shall be as one, and live out all our life together. Do you hear me, Dumiitruuu ... ? Well?"I ... I hear you," the youth answered, speaking to no one.And do you believe me? Say it--say that you believe in me, as your father's fathers believed in me.Dumitru was not sure he did believe, but the owner of the voice squeezed inside his head until he cried out, "Yes ... ! Yes, I believe, just as my fathers believed."Very well, said the voice, apparently placated. Then don't be so shy, Dumiitruuu: look upon my works without averting your eyes, without shrinking back. The pictures painted and graven in the walls--the many amphorae in their racks--the salts and powders contained in these ancient vessels ...In the flaring torchlight Dumitru looked. Racks of black oak standing everywhere, and on their shelves numberless jars, urns: amphorae, as the voice had termed them. Throughout these rooms in this subterranean hideaway, there must be several thousands of them, all tight-stoppered with plugs of oak in leaden sheaths, all with faded, centuries-stained labels pasted to them where handles joined necks. One rack had been shattered, thrown aside by a falling ceiling stone; its jars had been spilled, some of them breaking open. Powders had trickled out, forming small cones which themselveshad taken on the dust of decades, and when Dumitru looked at these spilled ... remains ... ?See how fine they are, these essential salts, whispered the voice in his head, which now contained a curiosity of its own, as if even the owner of that voice were awed by this ghoulish hoard. Stoop down, feel them in your hands, Dumiitruuu.The youth could not disobey; he sifted the powders, which were soft as talc and yet free as mercury; they ran through his fingers and left his hands clean, without residue. And while he handled the salts in this fashion, so the Thing in his mind gave a mental sniff: it seemed to taste of the essence of what it had bade Dumitru examine. And:Ah ... he was a Greek, this one! the voice informed. I recognise him--we conversed on several occasions. A priest from Greek land, aye, who knew the legends of the Vrykoulakas. He'd crusaded against them, he said, and carried his crusade across the sea to Moldavia, Wallachia, even to these very mountains. He built a grand church in Alba lulia, which possibly stands there even to this day, and from it would go out among the towns and villages to seek out the monstrous Vrykoulakas.Individuals of the townspeople would name their enemies, often knowing them for innocents; and depending on the power or stature of the accuser, the "Venerable" Arakli Aenos--as this one was called--would "prove" or "disprove" the accusation. For example: if a famous boyar gave evidence that such and such persons were bloodsucking demons, be sure that the Greek would discover them as such. But only let a poor man bring such a charge, however faithfully, and he might well be ignored or even punished for a liar! A witchfinder and a fake, old Aenos, who upon a time accused even myself! Aye, and I must needs flee to escape them from Visegrad, who came to put me down! Oh, I tell you, it was a very troublesome business, that time.But ... time settles many a score. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. When he died, they buried the old fraud in a lead-lined box in Alba Iulia, beside the church he'd built there. What a boon! For just exactly as had been intended, so the imperishablelead of his coffin sufficed to keep out the seepage and worms and all manner of rodent malefactor--until a time one hundred years later when I dug him up! Oh, yes--we conversed on several occasions. But in the end, what did he know? Nothing! A fraud, a faker!Still, I evened the score. That pile of dust you sifted there: Arakli Aenos himself--and ah, how he screeaaamed when I gave him back his form and flesh, and burned the dog with hot ironsss! Ha-haa-haaa!Dumitru hissed his horror and snatched back his fingers from the strewn "salts." He slapped his hands as if they, too, were burned with hot irons, blew on them, wiped them trembling down his coarsely woven trousers. He lurched upright and backed away from the broken urns, only to crash into another rack which stood behind him. He fell sprawling in dust and powder and salts; but his confusion had served to clear his mazed mind a little--which the owner of the voice at once recognised, so that now he tightened his grip.Steady now, steady, my son! Ah, I see: you think I torment you to no purpose--you believe I derive pleasure from such instruction. But no, no--I deem it only fair that you should know the gravity of the service you perform. You make unto me a considerable offering: of succor, sustenance, replenishment. Wherefore I grant you knowledge ... for however short a time. Now stand up, stand tall, hear well my words, and follow their directions.The walls, go to the walls, Dumiitruuu. Good! Now trace the frescoes--with your eyes, my son, and with your hands. Now look and learn:Here is a man. He is born, lives his life, dies. Prince or peasant, sinner or saint, all go the same way. You see them there in the pictures: holy men and blackguards alike, moving swiftly from cradle to grave, rushing headlong from the sweet, warm moment of conception to the cold, empty abyss of dissolution. It is the lot of all men, it would seem: to become one with the earth, and all the lessons learned in their lives wasted, and their secrets remaining secret unto them alone forever ...On?But some there are whose remains, by circumstance of their interment--like the Greek priest, perhaps--remain intact; and others, perhaps cremated and buried in jugs, whose powdered ashes are kept apart from the earth and pure. There they lie, a crumbled bone or two, a handful of dust, and in them all the knowledge of their waking seasons, all the secrets of life and sometimes of death--and maybe even conditions between the two--which they took with them to the grave. All lost.And again I say ... oh?And you will say: but what of knowledge in books, or knowledge passed down by word of mouth, or carved in stone? Surely a learned man, if he so desire, may leave his knowledge behind him for the benefit of others to come after?What? Stone tablets? Bah! Even the mountains are worn down and the epochs they have known blown away as dust. Word of mouth? Tell a man a story and by the time he retells it the theme is altered. After twenty tellings it may not even be recognised! Books? Given a century and they wither, two and they become so brittle as to snap, three--they crumble into nothing! No, don't speak of books. They are the most fragile of things. Why, there was once in Alexandria the world's most wondrous library ... and where, pray, are all of those books now? Gone, Dumiitruuu. Gone like all the men of yesteryear. But unlike the books, the men are not forgotten. Not necessarily ...And again, what if a man does not desire to leave his secrets behind him?But enough of that for now; for see, the frescoes are changed. And here is another man ... well, at least we shall call him a man. But strange, for he is not alone conceived of man and woman. See for yourself: for parent he has ... but what is this? A snake? A slug? And the creature issues an egg, which the man takes in unto him. And now this most fortunate person is no longer merely human but ... something else. Ah! And see--this one does not die but goes on and on! Always! Perhaps forever.Do you follow me, Dumiitruuu? Do you follow the pictures on the wall? Aye, and unless this very special One is slain by some brutal man who has the knowledge--or dies accidentally,which may occur upon a time--why, then he will go on forever! Except ... he has needs, this one. He may not sustain himself like ordinary men. Rather, he knows better sources of sustenance! The blood is the life ...Do you know the name of such a one, my son?"I ... I know what such men are called," Dumitru answered, for all the world speaking to a vault empty of life other than his own. "The Greeks call them 'Vrykoulakas,' as you have made mention; the Russians 'Viesczy'; and we Travellers, the Szgany, we call them 'Moroi'--vampires!"There is another name, said the voice, from a land far, far away in space and time. The name by which they know themselves: Wamphyri! And for a moment, perhaps in a certain reverence, the voice paused. Then:Now tell me, Dumiitruuu: do you know who I am? Oh, I know, I'm a voice in your head, but unless you're a madman, the voice must have a source. Have you guessed my identity, Dumiitruuu? Perhaps you've even known it all along, eh?"You are the Old One." Dumitru gulped, his Adam's apple bobbing, throat dry as a stick. "The undead, undying patron of the Szgany Zirra. You are Janos, the Baron Ferenczy!"Aye, and you may be a peasant but you're in no wise ignorant, answered the voice. Indeed I am that one! And you are mine to command as I will. But first a question: is there one among your father Vasile Zirra's band whose hands are three-fingered? A child, perhaps, male, born recently, since last you Szgany were here? Or perhaps a stranger you've seen on your travels, who desired to join your company?A strange question, some would think, but not Dumitru. It was part of the legend: that one day a man would come with three fingers on his hands instead of the usual four. Three broad, strong fingers and a thumb to each hand; born that way and natural enough; neither surgically contrived nor even grotesque to look upon. "No," he answered at once. "He has not come."The voice gave a mental grunt; Dumitru could almost see the impatient shrug of broad, powerful shoulders. And: Not come, the voice of Janos Ferenczy repeated him. Not yet come ...But ... the attitude of the unseen presence was mercurial; it changed in a moment; disappointment was put aside and resignation took its place. Ah, well, and so I wait out the years. What is time to the Wamphyri anyway, eh?Dumitru made no answer. In examining the faded frescoes, he had reached a part of the wall which showed several very gruesome scenes. The frescoes were like a tapestry, telling a story in pictures, but these pictures were straight out of nightmare. In the first, a man was held down by four others, one to each limb. A fifth tormentor in Turkish breeches stood over him with a curved sword raised high, while a sixth knelt close by with a mallet and sharp stake of wood. In the next picture the victim had been beheaded and the stake driven through him, pinning him down--but a huge, fat, sluglike worm or snake was emerging from his severed neck, so that the men about him reared back in horror! In a third picture the men had encircled the Thing with a ring of torches and were burning it; likewise the head and body of its once-host, upon a pile of faggots. The fourth and penultimate scene of the set was of a priest, swinging his censer in one hand, while with the other he poured the vampire's ashes into an urn. Presumably it was a rite of exorcism, of purification. But if so, then it was mistaken, wasted.For the final scene was of the same urn, and above it a black bat in flight, rising like a phoenix from the ashes. Indeed, the very sigil of the Ferenczy! And:Aye, said Janos darkly, in Dumitru's head, but not until the advent of the three-fingered man. Not until he comes, the true son of my sons. For only then may I escape from one vessel into the next. Ah, for there are vessels and there are vessels, Dumiitruuu, and some of them are of stone ...Again the youth's mind had started to unmaze itself. Of his own will, suddenly he saw how low his torch had burned where he'd placed it in a stone bracket on the wall. He tookit down and tremblingly lit another from it, waving it a little to get the flame going. And licking his dry lips, he looked at the myriad urns and wondered which one held his tormentor. How easy it would be to shatter the thing, scatter its dust, thrust his torch amongst those sentient remains and see if they'd burn a second time.Janos was not slow to note the resurgence of Szgany will, or to read the threat in the mind he'd mastered. He chuckled voicelessly and said, Ah, not here, not here, Dumiitruuu! What? You'd have me lie among scum? And could it be I heard you thinking treacherous thoughts just then? Still, you'd not be of the blood if you didn't, eh? And again his evil chuckle, following which: But you were right to rekindle your torch: best not let the flame die, Dumiitruuu, for it's an exceeding dark place you've come to. Also, there's yet a thing or two I want to show you, for which we'll need the light. Now see, there's a room to your right, my son. Go in through the archway, if you will, and there discover my true lair.Dumitru might have struggled with himself ... but useless; the vampire's grip on his mind had returned more solid than ever. He did as instructed, passing under the arch and into a room much like the others except for its appointments. No racks of amphorae or frescoed walls here; the place was more habitation than warehouse; woven tapestries were on the walls, and the floor was of green-glazed tiles set in mortar. Centrally, a mosaic of smaller tiles described the prophetic crest of the Ferenczy, while to one side and close to a massive fireplace stood an ancient table of dense, black oak.The wall hangings were falling into moldering tatters and the dust lay as thick here as anywhere, but yet there was a seeming anomaly. Upon the desk were papers, books, envelopes, various seals and waxes, pens and inks: modern things by comparison with anything else Dumitru had seen. The Ferenczy's things? He had assumed the Old One to be dead--or undead--but all of this seemed to suggest otherwise.No, the baron's viscous mental voice contradicted him, not mine but the property of ... shall we say, a student of mine? He studied my works, and might even have dared to studyme! Oh, he knew well enow the words to call me up, but he did not know where to find me, nor even that I was here at all! But alas, I fancy he's no more. Most likely his bones adorn the upper ruins somewhere. It shall delight me to discover them there one day, and do for him what he might so easily have done for me!While the voice of Janos Ferenczy so darkly and yet obscurely reminisced, so Dumitru Zirra had crossed to the table. There were copies of letters there, but not in any language he could read. He could make out the dates, though, from fifty years earlier, and something of the far-flung postal addresses and addressees. There had been a M. Raynaud in Paris, a Josef Nadek in Prague, one Colin Grieve in Edinburgh, and a Joseph Curwen in Providence; oh, and a host of others in the towns and cities of as many different lands again. The writer to all of these names and addresses, as witness his handwriting on the browned paper, was one and the same person: a certain Mr. Hutchinson, or "Edw. H." as he more frequently signed himself.As for the books: they meant nothing to Dumitru. A peasant, however much travelled and practised in certain tongues and dialects, such titles as the Turba Philosophorum, Bacon's Thesaurus Chemicus, and Trithemius's De Lapide Philosophico meant nothing to him. Or if they did, he made no real connection.But in one book which still lay open, and despite the dust lying thick on its pages, Dumitru saw pictures which did mean something, and something quite horrific. For there, in painstaking and pain-giving detail, were shown a series of the most hideous and brutal tortures, the like of which caused him--even half-hypnotised as he was--to flinch and draw back a little, distancing himself from the page. But in the next moment, his eyes were drawn to the rest of that room's appurtenances, which until now had not impressed themselves upon his mind; that is, to the great manacles fastened to the walls by heavy chains, to certain badly corroded implements idly tossed to the floor in one corner, and to theseveral iron braziers which still contained the ashes of olden fires!Before he could give these items any further attention, however, if he had wanted to:Dumiitruuu, crooned that gurgling voice in his head, now tell me: have you ever thirsted? Have you ever wandered in a dry desert, with never sight or sign of water, and felt your throat contract to a throbbing ulcer through which you can scarce draw breath? Well, possibly you may have known a time when you felt dry as salt, which might help you understand something of the way I feel now. But only something of it. Certainly you have never been as salt. Ah, if only I could describe my thirst, my son!But enough; I'm sure now that you perceive something of my arts, my meaning, my power and destiny, and that the requirements of One such as I have importance far above any question of common life and lives. And the time has come to introduce you to the final mystery, wherein we both shall know the most exquisite ecstasies. The great chimney, Dumiitruuu --go in.Go into a chimney, a fireplace? Dumitru looked at it, felt the urge to draw back from it, and could not. Massively built, the fire-scarred hole was all of four feet wide and five high, arched over and set with a central keystone at its top; he need stoop only a little to pass inside. Before doing so, he lit another torch--a pause which Janos Ferenczy saw as a sign of hesitancy. Quickly now, Dumiitruuu, the awful voice urged, for even in dissolution--no, especially in dissolution--my need is not to be kept waiting. It is such that I cannot endure it.Dumitru passed into the fireplace, held up his torch to light the place. Above him soared a wide, scorched flu, which angled back gradually into the wall. Holding his torch away, the youth looked for light from above and saw only darkness. That was not strange: the chimney must pass through several angles in its climb to the surface, and of course it would be blocked where the upper regions lay in ruins.Bringing the torch close again, Dumitru saw iron rungs set in the sloping back wall of the flue. In its heyday, the castle'schimneys would need sweeping from time to time. And yet ... there was no accumulation of soot such as might be expected; apart from a superficial scorching, the chimney seemed hardly used at all.Oh, it has been used, my son. Janos Ferenczy's mental voice chuckled obscenely. You shall see, you shall see. But first, step aside a little. Before you ascend there are those who must descend! Small minions of mine, small friends ...Dumitru crushed back against a side wall; there came a fluttering, rapidly amplified by the chimney into a roar, and a colony of small bats whose hurtling bodies formed an almost solid shaft rushed down and out from the flue, dispersing into the subterranean vaults. For long moments they issued from the flue, until Dumitru began to think they must be without number. But then the roaring in the chimney diminished, a few latecomers shot by him, and all was silence once more.Now climb, said the Ferenczy, again closing his grip on the mind of his mental slave.The rungs were wide and shallow, twelve inches apart, and set very firmly into the mortar between stones. Dumitru found that he could carry his torch and, using only his feet and one hand, still climb easily enough. After only nine or ten rungs the chimney narrowed considerably, and after as many again flattened through about forty-five degrees to become little more than an upward sloping shaft. Within the space of a further twenty feet the rungs petered out and were replaced by shallow slablike steps; the "floor" then levelled out entirely and the "ceiling" gradually receded to a height of some nine or ten feet.Now Dumitru found himself in a narrow, featureless stone passageway no more than three feet wide and of indeterminate length, where a feeling of utmost dread quickly enveloped him, bringing him to a crouching halt. Trembling and oozing cold sweat--with his heart fluttering in his chest like a trapped bird, and clammy perspiration sticking his clothes to his back and thighs--the youth thrust out his torch before him. Up ahead in the shadows where they flickered beyondthe full range of illumination, a pair of yellow triangular eyes--wolf eyes and feral--floated low to the floor and reflected the torch's fitful light. They were fixed upon Dumitru.An old friend of mine, Dumiitruuu. Janos Ferenczy's voice crawled in his mind like mental slime. Just like the Szgany, he and his kith and kin have watched over me many a year. Why, all manner of curious folk might come wandering up here but for these wolves of mine! Did he perhaps frighten you? You thought him below and behind you, and here he is ahead? But can't you see that this is my bolt hole? And what sort of a bolt hole, pray, with only one way in and out? No, only follow this passage far enough, and it emerges in a hole in the face of the sheer cliff. Except ... you shall not be required to go so far ...The voice scarcely bothered to disguise its threat; the Ferenczy would not be denied his due now; his grip on Dumitru's mind and will tightened like a vise of ice. And: Proceed, he coldly commanded.Ahead of the youth the great wolf turned and loped on, a grey shadow that merged with the greater darkness. Dumitru followed, his step uncertain, his heart pounding until he thought he could actually hear the blood singing in his ears, like the ocean in the whorl of a conch. And he wasn't the only one who could hear it.Ah, my son, my son! The voice was a gurgle of monstrous anticipation, of unbridled lust. Your heart leaps in you like a stag fixed with a bolt! Such strength, such youth! I feel it all! But whatever it is that causes such panic in you, be sure it is almost at an end, Dumiitruuu ...The passage widened; on Dumitru's left the wall as before, but on his right a depression, a trench running parallel, cut in the solid rock--indeed in bedrock--that deepened with each pace he took. He extended his torch out over the rim and looked down, and in the deepest section of the trench saw ... the rim and narrow neck of ... of a black urn, half-buried in dark soil!The rim of the urn--like a dark pouting mouth, with lips that seemed to expand and contract loathsomely in the flickeringlight--stood some five feet below the level of Dumitru's path. Beyond the urn, the bed of the trench had been raised up. Cut in a "V," like a sluice, it sloped gently downwards to a raised rim channelled into a narrow spout which projected directly over the mouth of the urn; in the other direction, the V-shaped bed sloped upwards and out of sight into shadows. The raised rim of rock and carved spout above the urn looked for all the world like guttering over a rain barrel, and like guttering they were stained black from the flow of some nameless liquid ...For several long moments Dumitru stood trembling there, gasping, not fully understanding what he saw but knowing

He gazed down through nite-lite binoculars on almost two acres of curved, silvery-grey surface covering the floor of the ravine. By the light of the moon that surface might easily be mistaken for ice, but Mikhail Simonov knew that it was no glacier or frozen river; it was a mass of metal some four hundred feet long by something less than two hundred wide. Along the irregular edges of its length, where its gently curving dome met the rocky walls of the gorge, and at both ends, where the arcing metal came up flush against massive concrete barriers or dams, the stuff was "only" six inches thick, but at its centre the moulded mass was all of twenty-four inches through. That was what had registered on the instruments of the American spy-satellites, anyway, and also the fact that this was the biggest man-made accumulation of lead anywhere in the world.It was like looking down on the three-quarters buried, lead-wrapped neck of some giant bottle, thought Mikhail Simonov. A magic bottle--except that in this case the cork had already been pulled and the genie flown, and Simonov was here to discover the nature ofthat very dubious fugitive. He gave a quiet snort, pushed his flight of fancy to the back of his mind, focused his eyes and concentrated his attention on the scene below.The bottom of the ravine had been a watercourse subject to severe seasonal flooding. Up-river, above the "wet" dam wall, an artificial lake was now full, its surface flat and likewise leaden--but only its surface. Channelled under the great roof of lead through unseen sluices, the water reappeared in four great shining spouts issuing from conduits in the lower wall. Spray rose up from that deluge, froze, fell or drifted back to coat the lower ravine in snow and ice, where for all the apparent volume of water only a stream now followed the ancient course. Under the shield of lead, four great turbines lay idle, bypassed by the hurtling waters bled off from the lake. They'd been at rest like that for two years now, since the day the Russians had tested their weapon for the first--and the last--time.Despite all the USSR's technological camouflaging countermeasures, that test, too, had been "seen" by the American spy-satellites. What exactly they saw had never been made public or even hinted at outside of higher-echelon and correspondingly low-profile government departments, but it had been sufficient to jolt America's SDI or "Star Wars" concept into real being. In very small, very powerful and highly secretive defence circles throughout the Western World there had been worried discussions about APB (Accelerated Particle Beam) "shields," about nuclear- or plasma-powered lasers, even about something called a "Magma Motor" which might theoretically tap the energy of the small black hole believed by some scientists to lie at Earth's core, simultaneously feeding upon and fuelling the planet; but all such discussions had been purely conjectural. Certainly nothing substantial--other than the evidence provided by the satellites--had leaked out of Russia herself; nothing, that is, in the way of normal intelligence reporting. No, for the Ural Mountains in theregion of Perchorsk had been for some time far more security-sensitive than even the Baikonur Space Centre in the days of the Sputniks. And it was a sensitivity which, in the aftermath of that single, frightful test, had suddenly increased fourfold.Simonov shivered in his white, fur-lined anorak, carefully demisted his binoculars, flattened himself more rigidly to the frozen ground between the boulders as scudding clouds parted and a nearly full moon blazed treacherously down on him. It was cold in the so-called "summer" up here, but in the late autumn it was a kind of frozen hell. It was autumn now; with a bit of luck Simonov would escape suffering through another winter. No, he mentally corrected himself, that would take a lot of luck. A hell of a lot!The scene below turned silver in the flooding moonlight, but the special lenses of Simonov's binoculars made automatic adjustment. Now he turned those lenses on the pass proper, or what had been the pass until the Perchorsk Projekt had got underway some five years ago.Here on the eastern side of the ravine, the pass had been eroded through the mountain's flank by one of the sources of the Sosva River on its way down to Berezov; on the western side, it had been dynamited through a deep saddle. Falling steeply from the mountains, its road roughly paralleled the course of the Kama River for two hundred and fifty miles to Berezniki and Perm on the Kirov-Sverdlovsk rail link.In the forty years prior to the Projekt, the pass had been used chiefly by loggers, trappers and prospectors, and for the transportation of agricultural implements and produce both ways across the range. In those days its narrow road had been literally carved and blasted from the solid rock, and so it had remained until recently: a rough and ready route through the mountains. But the Perchorsk Projekt had brought about drastic changes.With the construction of the Zapadno rail link to Serinskaja in the east, and the extension of the railway from Ukhta to Vorkuta in the north, the high pass had long since fallen out of favour as a route through the mountains; it had only remained important to a handful of local farmers and the like, whose livelihoods hardly mattered in the greater scheme of things. They had simply been "relocated." That had taken place four and a half years ago; then, with all the speed, ingenuity and muscle that a superpower can muster, the pass had been re-opened, widened, improved and given a two-lane system of good metalled roads. But not as a public highway, and certainly not for the use of the far-scattered "local" communities. Indeed, their use of the pass had been strictly forbidden.In all the project had taken almost three years to complete, during which time the Soviet intelligence services had leaked innocuous details of "a pass in the Urals which is undergoing repair and improvement." That had been the official line, to forestall or confuse the piecing together of the true picture as seen by the USA from space. And if additional proofs of the innocence of the Perchorsk Projekt were required, it could also be seen that gas and oil pipelines had been laid in the pass between Ukhta and the Ob gasfields. What the Russians couldn't conceal or misrepresent was the construction of dams and the movement of heavy machinery, the incredibly massive lead shield built up in layers over the erstwhile bed of a powerful ravine torrent, and perhaps most important, the gradual build-up of troop movement into the area to a permanent military presence. There had been a deal of blasting, excavation and/or tunnelling, too, with many thousands of tons of rock moved out by truck or simply dumped into local ravines, plus the installation of large quantities of sophisticated electrical equipment and other apparatus. Most of which had been seen from space, and all of which had intrigued and irritated the West's intelligenceand security services almost unendurably. As usual, the Soviets were making life very difficult. Whatever they were up to, they were doing it in an almost inaccessible, steep-sided ravine nine hundred feet deep, which meant that a satellite had to be almost directly overhead to get anything at all.Conjecture in the West had gone on unabated. The alternatives were many. Perhaps the Russians were attempting to carry out a covert mining operation? It could be that they'd discovered large deposits of high-grade uranium ore in the Urals. On the other hand, maybe they were concerned with the construction of experimental nuclear installations under the very mountains themselves. Or could it be that they were building and making ready to test something quite new and radically different? As it happened--when it happened, at that time just two years ago--advocates of the third alternative were seen to have guessed correctly.Once again Mikhail Simonov was drawn back to the present, this time by the low rumble of diesel-engined transports that echoed up hollowly from the gorge to drown out the wind's thin keening. Just as the moon slipped back behind the clouds, so the headlight beams of a convoy of lumbering trucks cut a swath of white light in the darkness where they stabbed out from the gash of the pass in the deep V of the western saddle. The huge, square-looking trucks were just under a mile away across the ravine and some five hundred feet below the level of Simonov's vantage point, but still he flattened himself more yet and squirmed back a little into his nest of gaunt boulders. It was a controlled, automatic, almost instinctive reaction to possible danger, in no way a panicked retreat. Simonov had been very well trained, with no expense spared.As the convoy came through the pass and turned its nose down the steeply descending ramp of a road cut from the face of the ravine, so a battery of spotlights burst into brilliant life, shining down from the sheerwall and lending the well-gritted road excellent illumination. Fascinated, Simonov listened to the great diesels snarling into low gear, watched the routine of a well organized reception.Without taking the nite-lite from his eyes, he reached into a pocket and drew out a tiny camera, snapping it into position in the lower casing of the binoculars. Then he pressed a button on the camera and continued watching. Whatever he saw would now be recorded automatically, one frame every six seconds for a total of four and a half minutes, forty-five tiny stills of near-crystal clarity. Not that he expected to see anything of any real importance: he already knew what the trucks contained and the camera shots were simply to certify that this was indeed their destination--for the satisfaction of others back in the West.Four trucks: one of them containing all the makings of a ten-foot electrified fence, two more carrying the component parts and ammo for three twin-mounted, armour-piercing, 13mm. Katushev cannons, and the fourth and last loaded with a battery of diesel-powered generators. No, what was being hauled wasn't the question. The question was this: if the Russians were going to defend the Perchorsk Projekt, who were they defending it against?Who ... or what?Simonov's camera clicked almost inaudibly away; his eyes took in all that was happening below; he was aware that he mustn't stay here more than another ten or fifteen minutes at the most, because of the high radiation count, but part of his mind was already somewhere else. It was back in London just two months short of two years ago. Shooting the arrival of the trucks had done it, set Simonov's mind working on that other film he'd been shown by MI6 and the Americans in London. A real film, however short, and not just stills. He relaxed just a fraction. He was doing all that was expected of him, could afford a little mental meandering.And actually, once you'd seen that film, it was difficult not to keep going back to it.The film was of something that had happened just seven weeks after the Perchorsk Incident (called "pi") and had earned itself the acronym "pi II" or "Pill." But it had been one hell of a pill to swallow. It had come about like this.Â <BR>... Early morning of a bright mid-October day along the eastern seaboard of the USA; but along the "obsolete" Canadian DEW-line things have been stirring for some three hours, since a pair of spysats with overlapping windows on the Barents and Kara seas, and from Arkhangel'sk across the Urals to Igarka, flashed intruder reports down across the Pole to listeners in Canada and the USAF bases in Maine and New Hampshire. Washington has been informed, and low-key alert status has already been notified to the missile bases in Greenland and the Foxe Peninsula base on Baffin Island. Other DEW-line subscribers have been notified; Great Britain has shown mild interest and asked for updates, Denmark is typically nervous (because of Greenland), Iceland has shrugged and France has failed to acknowledge.But now things begin to speed up a little. The original spies-in-the-sky have lost the intruder (an "intruder" being any aerial object passing east to west across the Arctic Ocean) out of their windows, but at the same time it's been picked up by DEW-line proper crossing the Arctic Circle on a somewhat irregular course but generally in the direction of Queen Elizabeth Island. What's more, the Russians have scrambled a pair of Mig interceptors from their military airfield in Kirovsk, south of Murmansk. Norway and Sweden join Denmark in an attack of the jitters. The USA is hugely curious but not yet narrow-eyed (the object is too slow to be a serious threat) but nevertheless an AWACS reconnaissance aircraft has been diverted from routine duties to aline of interception and two fighters are scrambled up from a strip near Fort Fairfield, Maine.It is now four hours since the--UFO?--was first sighted over Novaya Zemlya, and so far it has covered a little more than nine hundred miles, having passed west of Franz Josef Land on what now seems a beeline for Ellesmere Island. Which is where the Migs draw level with it, except that doesn't quite show the whole picture. Geographically they've caught up with it, but they're at max. headroom and the UFO is two miles higher! Then ... apparently they see it--and at the same time it sees them.What happens then isn't known for a certainty, for the Kirovsk base has ordered radio silence, but on the basis of what will be seen to happen later we can take a broad stab at it. The object descends, puts on speed, attacks! The Migs probably open fire on it in the seconds before they are reduced to so much confetti. Their debris is lost in snow and ice some six hundred miles from the Pole and a like distance short of Ellesmere ...And now the intruder really is intruding! Its speed has accelerated to around three hundred and fifty miles per hour and its course is straight as an arrow. The AWACS has reported the Migs lost from its screens, presumed down, but a hotline call from Washington to Moscow fails to produce anything but the usual ambiguities: "What Migs? What intruder?"The USA is a little peeved: "This aircraft came out of your airspace into ours. It has no right being there. If it sticks to its present course it will be intercepted, forced to land. If it fails to comply or acts in any way hostile, there's a chance it will be shot down, destroyed ..."And unexpectedly: "Good!" from the Russians. "Whatever it is you have on your screens, it is nothing of ours. We renounce it utterly. Do with it as you see fit!"Far more detailed Norwegian reports are now in from the Hammerfest listening station: the object is believed to originate from a region in the Urals near Labytnangi right on the Arctic Circle, give or take a hundred miles or so. If they had given or taken three hundred miles south, then the reports would have been more nearly correct; for the Perchorsk Pass was just that far away from the source they'd quoted. Alas, in the other direction, north of Labytnangi, lay Vorkuta, the USSR's most northerly missile site, supplied by rail from Ukhta. And now the Americans go from mildly irritated to extremely narrow-eyed. Just what in hell are the Reds up to? Have they loosed some sort of experimental missile from Vorkuta and lost it? If so, does it have a warhead?How many warheads?Alert classifications go up two notches and Moscow comes under fire in some very heated hotline exchanges. Still the Soviets deny all knowledge, however nervously.Better, clearer reports are coming in. We now have the thing on satellite, on ground radar, on AWACS. No physical, human sightings as yet but everything else. The spysats say it could be a dense flock of birds--but what sort of birds fly in excess of three hundred mph five miles high across the Arctic Circle? Collision with birds could have taken out the Migs, of course, but ... The top-secret high-tech radar sites along the older DEW-line say it's either a large airplane or ... a space-platform fallen out of orbit? Also that it's impossibly low on metal content--namely, it doesn't have any! But intelligence won't admit of any aircraft (not to mention space-stations) two hundred and some feet long and constructed of canvas. AWACS says that the thing is flying in a series of spurts or jets, like some vast aerial octopus. And AWACS is more or less right.It is now one hour since the American interceptors scrambled. Flying at close to Mach II, they have crossedthe Hudson Bay from the Belcher Islands to a point about two hundred miles north of Churchill. In so doing they've just overtaken the AWACS and left it a few minutes behind. The AWACS has told them that their target is dead ahead, and that he's come down to 10,000 feet. And now, finally, just like the Migs before them, they spot the intruder.That had been the narrative, the scenario that the CIA and MI6 had set for Simonov before showing him the AWACS film; and as the Briefing Officer had spoken those last three words, "spot the intruder," so the film had started to roll. All very dramatic, and deservedly so ...Â <BR>"Spot the intruder," thought Simonov now, the words bitter on his tongue so that he almost spat them out loud. By God, yes! For that was the name of the game, wasn't it? In security, intelligence, spying: Spot the Intruder. And all sides playing it expertly, some a little better than others. Right here and now he was the intruder: Michael J. Simmons, alias Mikhail Simonov. Except he hadn't been spotted yet.Then, as he re-directed all of his concentration back down onto the scene in the ravine, he sensed or heard something that didn't belong. From somewhere behind and below him had come the chink of a dislodged pebble, then lesser clatterings as the tumbling stone picked up smaller cousins on its way down the side of the mountain. The last leg of the climb had been along a steep, terraced ridge of rock, more a scramble than a real climb, and there had been plenty of loose scree and stony debris littered about. It could be that in his passing he'd left a pebble precariously balanced on some ledge, and that a strong gust had dislodged it. Simonov fancied that was all there was to it, but--What if it was something else? He'd had this feeling recently--a sort of uneasy, half-formed suspicion--that someone, somehow, was aware of him. Someone he'drather was not aware of him. He supposed this was a feeling spies learned to live with. Maybe it was just that everything had seemed to be going so smoothly, so that now he'd started to invent difficulties. He hoped that was all it was. But just to be sure ...Without looking back or changing his position, he unzipped his anorak, reached inside and came out with a blocky, wicked-looking short-barrelled automatic, its stubby silencer already attached. He checked the magazine, and silently eased it up again into the grip. And all of this done one-handed, with practiced ease, without pausing in the filming of the trucks in the ravine. Maybe the last couple of frames would be a bit off-centre. No big deal. Simonov was satisfied with what he'd got.The tiny camera attached to Simonov's nite-lite clicked one last time and gave a warning whir, signalling that the sequence was complete. He unclipped the camera and put it away. Then he wedged his binoculars securely in the base of a boulder, carefully cocked his pistol, squirmed about face and got to his knees. Still concealed, he peered cautiously through the V formed where the tops of two rounded boulders leaned together. Nothing back there. Nothing he could see, anyway. Steep cliffs falling away for a thousand feet, with spurs extending here and there, and thinly drifted snow lying white and gleaming on all flat surfaces. And way down there, obscured by the night, the tree-line and gentling lower slopes. Everything motionless and monochrome in dim starshine and occasional moonlight, where only the thin wind scattered little flurries of snow from the spurs and high ledges. There were plenty of places where men could hide themselves, of course--no one knew that better than Simonov, himself an expert in concealment--but on the other hand, if he'd been followed, why would they want to come up here? Easier to wait for him below, surely? Yet still the feeling persisted that he was not alone, that feeling which hadgrown in him increasingly over his last two or three visits to this place.This place, this spawning ground for utterly alien monsters ...He got back down into his original position, recovered the nite-lites and brought them to his eyes. In the ravine, where the steep road hugged the face of the defile down to the towering twin walls of the dam and the curved lead surface between them, a cavernous opening in the cliff blazed with light. The last truck turned left off the road onto a level staging area, then passed in through huge, wheeled, steel-framed lead doors. A gang of yellow-clad traffic controllers flagged the truck rumbingly inside and out of sight, then followed it into the blaze of illumination under the cliff. Other men came hurrying down the road, gathering up flashing beacons. The great doors had clanged shut by the time they reached them, but a wicket-gate thick as the door of a vault had been left open, issuing a square beam of yellow light. It swallowed up the men with the traffic beacons, then was closed. The floodlights over the pass snapped out and left stark blackness in their wake. Only the dammed watercourse and the great lead shield were left to reflect the starshine.But all of that lead down there. And these poisoned heights, a little more than mildly radioactive. And that Thing filmed by the AWACS as it did battle with the USAF jet fighters. Simonov couldn't suppress a small shudder, which this time wasn't due to the intense cold. He folded his nite-lites into a flat, leather-cased shape which he slipped inside his anorak with the strap still round his neck. Then for a moment longer he just lay there, his eyes staring into the enigmatic gulf below, his mind superimposing on the darkness the sequence of events he'd witnessed in London, recorded on that flickering AWACS film ...But even remembering it, he cringed away from it. Bad enough that he still occasionally saw it in hisdreams! But could that ... that ... whatever it had been, could it really have come from here? A monstrous mutation? A gigantic, hideous warrior clone conjured in some crazed geneticist's incredible experiment? A "biological" weapon outside all of man's previous experience and understanding? That was what he was here to find out. Or rather, it was what he was here to prove conclusively: that indeed this was where that Thing had been born--or made. That seething, pulsing, writhing--Snow crunched softly, compacted by a stealthy footfall!Simonov thrust himself to his feet, turning as he rose, and saw a head and staring eyes outlined briefly above the low jumble of rocks. His automatic was in his hand as he launched himself into a dive to the left of the boulders, his right arm outstretched, ready to target his weapon. A man in a pure white parka was crouched behind the boulders, with a gun in his hand which he even now lifted to point at Simonov. In the instant before Simonov came down on his side in the snow he snapped off two shots; the first one struck the man in the shoulder, snatching him upright, and the second slammed into his chest, flinging him backwards and down onto the patchy snow.The dull phut, phut, of Simonov's silenced weapon had caused no echoes, but he'd scarcely caught his breath when there came a hoarse, gasping grunt from close at hand and silver glinted in a sudden flood of moonlight. The snow on Simonov's left-hand side, not eighteen inches away, erupted in a spray of frantic activity. "Bastard!" a voice snarled in Russian as a massive hand reached out to grasp Simonov's hair and an ice-axe came arcing down, its spike impaling his gun-hand through the wrist and almost nailing it to the stony ground.The Russian had been lying in a snow-filled depression, waiting. Now he sprawled forward, trying to hurl his bulk on top of Simonov. The agent saw a dark face,a white bar of snarling teeth framed in a beard and a ruff of white fur, and drove his left elbow into it with as much force as he could muster. Teeth and bone crunched and the Russian gave a gurgling shriek, but he didn't release his grip on Simonov's hair. Then, cursing through blood and snot, the massive Soviet drew back his ice-axe for a second swipe.Simonov tried to bring his gun to bear. Useless--there was no feeling in his hand, which flopped like a speared fish. The Russian hunched over him, dripped blood on him, changed his grip to Simonov's throat and drew back his axe menacingly."Karl!" came a voice from the shadows of other boulders. "We want him alive!""How much alive?" Karl choked the words out, spitting blood. But in the next moment he dropped the axe and instead drove a fist hard as iron to Simonov's forehead. The spy went out like a light, almost gladly.A third Russian figure came out of the night, went to his knees beside Simonov's prone form. He felt the unconscious man's pulse, said: "Are you all right, Karl? If so, please see to Boris. I think this one put a couple of bullets into him!""Think? Well, I was closer than you, and I can assure you he did!" Karl growled. Gingerly touching his broken face with trembling fingertips, he went to where Boris lay spreadeagled."Dead?" the man on his knees beside Simonov inquired, his voice low."As a side of beef," Karl grunted. "Dead as that one should be," he pointed an accusing finger at Simonov. "He's killed Boris, messed up my face--you should let me twist his fucking head off!""Hardly original, Karl," the other tut-tutted. He stood up.He was tall, this leader, but slender as a rod even in his bulky parka. His face was pale and thin-lipped, sardonic in the moonlight, but his sunken eyes werebright as dark jewels. His name was Chingiz Khuv and he was a Major--but in his specialized branch of the KGB the wearing of uniforms and the use of titles and rank were to be avoided. Anonymity increased productivity, ensured longevity. Khuv forgot who'd said that, but he agreed wholeheartedly: anonymity did both of those things. But at the same time one must make sure it did not detract from authority."He's an enemy, isn't he?" Karl growled."Oh, yes, he's that all right--but he's only one and our enemies are many. I agree it would be very satisfying to squeeze his throat, and who knows but that you'll get your chance--but not until I've squeezed his brain.""I need attention." Karl held snow tenderly to his face."So does he," Khuv nodded at Simonov. "And so does poor Boris." He went back to his hiding place in the rocks and brought out a pocket radio. Extending its aerial, he spoke into the mouthpiece, saying: "Zero, this is Khuv. Get the rescue chopper up here at once. We're a kilometer up river from the Projekt, on top of the eastern ridge. The pilot will see my torch ... Over.""Zero: at once, Comrade--out," came back the answer, tinny and with a touch of static. Khuv took out a heavy-duty torch and switched it on, stood it upright on the ground and packed snow around its base. Then he unzipped Simonov's anorak and began to turn out his pockets. There wasn't much: the nite-lites, spare clips for the automatic, Russian cigarettes, the slightly crumpled photograph of a slim peasant girl sitting in a field of daisies, a pencil and tiny pad of paper, half a dozen loose matches, an "official" Soviet Citizen's ID, and a curved strip of rubber half an inch thick by two inches long. Khuv stared at the block of black rubber for long moments. It had indentations that looked like--"Teeth marks!" Khuv nodded."Eh?" Karl mumbled. He had come to see whatKhuv was doing. He spoke through a handful of bloody snow with which he staunched the wounds to his nose and lips. "What? Did you say teeth marks?"Khuv showed him the rubber. "It's a makeshift gumshield," he informed. "I'd guess he puts it in at night--to keep from grinding his teeth!"They got down on their knees beside Simonov where Karl could work on his jaws. The unconscious man groaned and twitched a little but finally succumbed to the pressure of the Russian's huge hands. Karl forced his mouth wide open, said: "There's a pencil torch in my top pocket." Khuv fumbled the torch out of the other's pocket, shone it into Simonov's mouth. Lower left, at the back, second forward from the wisdom tooth--there it was. A capped tooth at first glance, but on closer inspection a hollow tooth containing a tiny cylinder: Part of the enamel had worn away, showing bright metal underneath."Cyanide?" Karl wondered."No, they've got a lot better stuff than that these days," Khuv answered. "Instantaneous, totally painless. We'd better get it out before he wakes up. You never know, he might just want to be a hero!""Turn his face left-side down on the ground," Karl grunted. He had put both Simonov's and Boris's guns in a huge pocket; now he took them out and used the butt of Simonov's weapon as a wedge between his jaws. His dead comrade's gun had a barrel that was long and slender. "This is not going to hurt me more than it hurts him!" Karl grunted. "I think Boris would like it that I'm using his gun.""What?" Khuv almost shouted. "You'd shoot it out? You'll ruin his face and the shock might kill him!""I would love to shoot it out," Karl answered, "but that isn't my intention." He poised the heel of his free hand over the weapon's butt.Khuv looked away. This part of it was for such as Karl. Khuv liked to think he stood a little above sheeranimal brutality. He looked out over the rim of the ridge, gritted his own teeth in a sort of morbid empathy as he heard Karl's hammer hand come down with a smack on the butt of the gun. And:"There!" said Karl with some satisfaction. "Done!" In fact he'd got two teeth, whole, the one with the cylinder and its neighbour. Now he used a grimy finger to hook them out of Simonov's bloody mouth. "All done," Karl said again, "and I didn't break the cylinder. See, the cap's still secure on the top. He was just about to wake up, I think, but that bit of additional pain should keep him under.""Well done," said Khuv with a small shudder. "Pack some snow in his mouth--but not too much!" He inclined his head, added, "Here they come."Dim, artificial light washed up from the gorge like the pulse of a far false dawn. It brightened rapidly. With it came the slicing whup, whup, whup, of a helicopter's rotors ...Â <BR>Jazz Simmons was falling, falling, falling. He'd been on top of a mountain and had somehow fallen off. It was a very high mountain and it was taking him a long time to hit the bottom. Indeed, he'd been falling for so long that the motion now seemed like floating. Floating in air, frog-shaped, free-falling like an expert parachutist waiting for the right moment to open his chute. Except Jazz had no chute. Also, he must have hit his face on something as he fell, for his mouth was full of blood.Nausea and vomiting woke him up from nightmare to nightmarish reality. He was falling! In the next moment, remembering everything, the thought flashed through his mind:God! They've tossed me into the ravine!But he wasn't falling, only floating. At least that part of his dream was real. And now as his brain got in gear and shock receded a little, so he felt the tight grip of hisharness and the down-draft of the helicopter's great fan overhead. He craned his neck and twisted his body, and somehow managed to look up. Way up there a chopper, its spotlights probing the depths of the ravine, but directly overhead ...Directly overhead a dead man twirled slowly on a second line, a hook through his belt, his arms and legs loosely dangling. His dead eyes were open and each time he came round they stared into Jazz's eyes. From the splashes of crimson on his white parka Jazz supposed it was the man he'd shot.Then--Shock returned with a vengeance, weightlessness and vertigo and cold, blasting air and noise combining to put him down a second time. The last thing he remembered as he fell into another ravine, the night black pit of merciful oblivion, was to wonder why his mouth was full of blood and what had happened to his teeth.Mere moments after he'd passed out the helicopter lowered him to the flat top of the upper dam wall and yellow-jacketted men removed him and his harness complete from his hook. They took Boris Dudko down, too, a heroic son of Mother Russia. After that ... their handling of Jazz Simmons wasn't too gentle, but he neither knew nor cared.Nor did he know that he was about to experience the dream of every intelligence boss in the western world: he was about to be taken inside the Perchorsk Projekt.Getting out again would be a different thing entirely ...Copyright © 1989 by Brian Lumley NecroscopeÂ® is a registered trademark of Brian Lumley

As an evil pair of vampire lords and a deadly lady invade Earth, Hary Keogh, the Necroscope, is dead, and a new, untried Necroscope must overcome conflicting loyalties to lead E-Branch against the vampires. 35,000 first printing.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Vast in scope and overripe with extraordinary characters and incidents, Lumleys proliferating Necroscope saga almost mandates a book-length reference companion. This new novel, the 11th in the series (after Resurgence, 1996) and the first in an offshoot trilogy, carries on the tradition in fine form, but also shows the problems inherent in keeping the increasingly byzantine intrigues of these horror/espionage hybrids accessible to new readers. During an explosive start, in which psychic agents of the hard-working E- (short for ESP) Branch smoke out a nest of vampires in the Australian desert, the novel introduces Jake Cutter, another of Lumleys gutsy populist heroes. Jake has been delivered to the paranormal intelligence unit by the ghost of Harry Keogh, the original Necroscope, who foresees a future clash between Jake and a vampire trio wreaking havoc on Earth. Harrys discorporate consciousness takes up residence in Jakes mind, but Jake is totally ignorant of the vampire invaders from the alternate universe of Sunside/Starside and the long-running war that left Harry (and, by proxy, Jake) infected with their taint. This necessitates a lengthy and tedious history of events from the preceding novels, recounted to Jake by both mortals and monsters in multiple chapters of straight exposition. Granted, Lumleys characters are a lively bunch, but none tell the story as excitingly as he does, and the result is not unlike sitting down at the dinner table with a hearty appetite and hearing about a sumptuous banquet someone else attended. A climactic encounter with the vampire Nephran Malinari in his aerie in the Australian mountains gets the action roaring again by the storys finale, and with luck heralds the end of the laborious updates. <BR>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>Lumley continues his popular series of vampire thrillers with the first book in a prospective trilogy. Jake Cutter is in line to succeed the late Harry Keogh as the Necroscope, or leading finder-hunter of vampires. Jake has his own agenda, however, and a troubled personal history, which make E-Branch more than a trifle uncertain about taking him on, until it becomes clear that the most powerful of three Wamphyri newly loose on Earth has set up business in Australia and needs to be stopped--yesterday! Lumley has firmly staked out the territory of the vampire thriller, much as Anne Rice has that of vampire erotica, and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro that of the vampire historical romance. This book is a good place to start Lumley's Necroscope saga. Oh, some of its most gripping sequences (e.g., the invasion of the three Wamphyri lords and the enslavement of Korath Mindthrall) are told indirectly, which somewhat diminishes their emotional impact, but the action climax is a corker. Roland Green<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>The amazingly prolific Lumley (1998's Maze of Worlds and over 40 doorstopper volumes) kicks off a new branch of his Necroscope series now that the original Necroscope (or vampire killer), Harry Keogh, is dead. The new novel stands alone, although it's clear that the team from Britain's E-Branch (ESP) knows at the end that many invaders still live and are breeding, and that Lord Nephran Molinari may be running but can never hide from E-Branch. At the start, Lord Molinari has taken over Xanadu, a glass-domed pleasure palace in the Australian outback, had all glass painted black inside and out (to keep out the sun's rays), and filled caves measureless to man with his minions. New vampire slayers to arrive at Xanadu are budding telepath Liz Merrick, who can receive but not send, and Jake Cutter, whose secret abilities will not be revealed here. Soon, Liz and Jake are drawn into the vampire mines, where, with silver bullets and flamethrowers, they work their way out of endless cliffhangers brought about by attacking Wamphyri. Did the invaders have anything to do with the firestorm from hell, the huge fireball that traveled a hundred miles an hour and burned up the entire Australian town of Dirranbandi in one blazing swoop? Jake proves to be the new Necroscope, especially when in a dream, using Deadspeak, he contacts the late Harry Keogh and is trained in sidereal mathematics, numbers that will help him slay Wamphyri. Necroscope fans will find themselves reading as fast as Lumley can type, and new readers may apply as well with this inaugural Jake Cutter entry. -- Copyright ©1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jake Cutter is reluctantly learning how to be a Necroscope--how to use the Mobius continuum to travel instantaneously from place to place, how to talk to the dead--but dead humans don't like him much. It seems Jake's got a hitchhiker named Korath. Since Korath holds the key to the Mobius equations, Jake can't just kick him out . . . though he's certainly trying.<BR><BR>Jake's not sure he really wants to be a member of E-Branch, the supersecret ESP-powered organization that's dedicated to eradicating the vampire infestation of Earth. To the freewheeling, passionate Jake, the E-Branchers seem a little stuffy and hidebound--except for the lovely Liz, whom Jake wants to get to know better, body and mind. But Liz is a telepath, and if Jake's not careful, she'll find out about Korath. And that will likely be the end of Jake Cutter.<BR><BR>In Australia, Jake helped E-Branch destroy the aerie of the mind-master , Nephtam Malinari, one of a trio of Great Vampires who came to Earth from the vampire world. Malinari escaped and went to ground with the hideously beautiful Lady Vavara.

Harry was such a skilled linguist of "deadspeak" that the British Secret Service recruited him into E-Branch, its ace paranormal unit. Harry waged a war against vampires--until the tables turned and he became another bloodsucking statistic. No longer a Necroscope (top vampire hunter), now he's a kind of advisor who beams helpful thoughts from the afterlife.<BR><BR>E-Branch's vampire woes intensify in Necroscope Defilers, the 12th installment of Lumley's series. A trio of seriously nasty critters are spreading their spawn on earth, but E-Branch is in crisis. Jake Cutter, the new Necroscope, is preoccupied with a personal vendetta--he's hunting down the Sicilian mobsters who killed his girlfriend. Jake also faces another minor distraction--a dead vampire named Korath is stuck inside his head, whispering evil nothings into his ear all day long. As the unholy monsters descend upon the Greek island of Krassos, it seems all hell will break loose--literally. Will Jake return to E-Branch and help annihilate this unholy scum, or is mankind doomed? <BR><BR>Although Necroscope Defilers is a little light on original plot twists, Lumley's curious country is still a land worth visiting, halfway between science fiction and dark fantasy. --Naomi Gesinger <BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>The 12th novel in Lumley's Necroscope series shows the hitherto vigorous vampire epic getting long in the tooth. Though it features the usual vast and vivid cast of psychic sleuths and earthly undead monsters, it is noticeably stingy with the plot twists and full-throttle action that have made the saga a formidable fusion of espionage and supernatural horror. The trio of other-dimensional Wamphyri who took refuge on Earth in Necroscope: Invaders are still on the loose at the novel's start, and Ben Trask's indefatigable E- (short for ESP) Branch is determined to prevent them from spreading the infectious vampire fungi. To kill time while they follow clues that lead them to the vampire stronghold in a convent on the Greek island of Krassos, Ben and his operatives converse in tedious exchanges that seem not so much dialogue as lectures and briefings for the reader's benefit. Similarly, the vampire master Nephran Malinari and the Lady Vavara snipe incessantly at one another in melodramatic Dark Shadows swatches. The problem is most acute in nominal hero Jake Cutter, who spends most of the tale sidetracked on a personal vendetta against a mafia kingpin, sparring mentally with the absorbed consciousness of the vampire Korath, who whispers nonstop provocations in his ear as part of their Faustian pact.

Thus, to all intents and purposes, he is dead.Death: the cessation of life. The absence of life, and the End of Being. Or at least, the living have always deemed it so. But as the Necroscope above all others (except perhaps the dead themselves) was aware, death isn't like that. Mind goes on.For how may any great poet, scientist, artist, or architect simply dissolve to nothing? His body may quit, but his spirit--his mind--will go on, and what he pursued in life he will continue to pursue in death.Great paintings are planned, and landscapes scanned in the dead mind's eye, and never a brush applied to canvas. Magnificent cities rear, and ocean-spanning roadways circle the planet, but they are only the dreams of their dead architects. Songs as sweet and sweeter than anything devised by Solomon in his lifetime are known to the teeming dead, which can never be known to the living; for he sang the ones we know more than two thousand years ago, and time has improved him.But here a seeming contradiction: if death is such an empty, silent place, how then all the singing, painting, building? How do the dead go on?To questions such as this there was no answer until there was the Necro-scope: a man who could look into the graves of men and into their dead minds. And through him--only through Harry Keogh--the dead were enabled. He taught them deadspeak, how to converse with one another, and joined them up across the world; he brought sons and daughters to long-lost mothers and fathers, reunited old friends, resolved old doubts and arguments and reinspired the brilliance of great minds guttering low. And without ever intending it--scarcely realizing what was happening--he became a lone candle flickering in the long night of the dead. And they basked in his warmth and loved him for it.But as much as Harry Keogh gave the dead, just so much and more he received. From his mother, who in life had been a psychic medium, the germ of that metaphysical skill from which his greater abilities derived. From August Ferdinand Möbius, a long-dead mathematician and astronomer, knowledge andmastery of the Möbius Continuum, an undimensioned place (for want of a better description) parallel with all time and space. And from Faethor Ferenczy, the history of a vampire world and its undead inhabitants, some of which--much like Faethor himself--had from time to time found their way into our world. But it should be stated that this latter knowledge was obtained more out of the extinct vampire's longing for life than his love of the Necroscope ...And from that time on--from Harry's discovery of vampires in our world, to the time of his "death" in Starside--the Necroscope was dedicated to their destruction. For he knew that if the terrible Lords and Ladies of the Wamphyri weren't put down, then that they must surely enslave mankind.But in the end--himself a vampire and fighting the Thing within him to his last breath--even Harry gave in, "died," and was no more. Oh, really ... ?But for every rule there has to be an exception, and Harry Keogh, Necroscope, was--he is--the exception to the rule of negative interaction between the Great Majority and the living. For in life he was the master of the Möbius Continuum, and used it to pursue vampires. So that now, in death ... ?Â <BR>Harry Keogh was not alone in his lifelong war against the Wamphyri. Recruited into E-Branch as a youth, he had the backing of that most secret of secret organizations almost to the end. And even when Harry was himself no longer entirely human, still Ben Trask, the Head of E-Branch, was his friend. It was Trask, the human lie detector, who saw the "truth" of Harry: that he would never turn on his own kind; but still, best to take no chances, and Trask had been tasked to hound him from Earth.Nevertheless, when at last the Necroscope returned to Sunside/Starside, to fight his last great battle there, he went of his own accord and not because he was driven out.And it was Ben Trask, too, along with many more members of E-Branch, who saw--who were given to see--Harry's passing on the night he died.It was a vision, a hologram, a real yet unreal thing. They saw The End of Harry as if it were here and now when in fact it occurred in an alien world on the other side of space-time.Thirteen witnesses in all, in the ops room at E-Branch HQ; they all saw the same thing: that smoking, smouldering, hideous corpse, cruciform and crucified in midair, tumbling backwards, head over heels, free of the floor as on an invisible spit. And despite the crisped and blackened face, Ben Trask had known who it was, that this was Harry.And for all that they encircled it, still the thing seemed to fall away from them, growing smaller, receding toward a nebulous origin--or destiny?--out of which ribbons of neon light reached like myriad writhing tentacles to welcome it.The figure dwindled, shrank to a mote, and finally disappeared. But where it had been--An explosion! A sunburst of golden fire, expanding hugely, silently, awesomely!So that the thirteen observers had gasped and ducked down; and despite that this thing was in their group mind, they instinctively turned away from the blinding intensity of its glare--and of what flew out of it. All except Trask, who had shielded his eyes but continued to watch, because that was his nature and he must know the truth.And the truth of it had been fantastic.Those myriad golden splinters speeding outwards from the sunburst, angling this way and that, sentient, seeking, disappearing into as many unknown places. Those, what, pieces? Of the Necroscope, Harry Keogh? All that remained of him, of what he'd been and what he'd meant? And as the last of them had zipped by Trask and vanished from view, so the writhing streamers of red, blue, and green ghost-light had likewise blinked out of existence ...... Returning the ops room's illumination to normal. Then everyone had known that Harry was no more, that he had died in Starside in an alien vampire world. And only Ben Trask--Trask the human lie detector--recognized the "truth" of what he had seen, and knew that death, especially in the Necroscope's case, simply wasn't like that ...Â <BR>Time has passed, twenty-one years of time, during which a different Necroscope--but a true son of his Earth father--has come to manhood in that same alien world that claimed Harry. And no less than his father, Nathan Kiklu (called Keogh by his friends in our world) is a vampire hunter. But Nathan has his own problems and hunts his enemies in Sunside/Starside.Between the Earth and Nathan's parallel vampire world are two "Gates." One is natural, the other came into being when an ill-conceived Soviet experiment backfired. The first Gate lies along the route of a subterranean river flowing through a cavern system under the foothills of the frowning Carpatii Meridionali, the Transylvanian Alps.The second Gate lies in an artificial complex built in the late '70s and early '80s by the Soviets in the base of the Perchorsk ravine in the northern reaches of the Uralski Kbrebet--Russia's Ural Mountains. While E-Branch has access to and control of the natural Gate, the Perchorsk Complex lies outside the Branch's sphere of influence. Closed down five years ago by the Russian premier, who diverted water from the Perchorsk dam into the mainly ruinous scientific complex to flood it, recently the artificial Gate has been reopened by the leader of a burgeoning military faction. This was done out of greed; the power-mad Russian general who ordered it had found out that Sunside/Starside is rich in gold; he and a platoon of soldiers went through into Starside in an attempt to fathom the extent of its riches.Their expedition coincided with a vampire resurgence; the Russians were taken, and before the general was done away with, two Lords and a Lady of the Wamphyri extracted from him and the men in his command knowledge of our world.Under constant guerilla attack by Nathan, the three Great Vampires, Wamphyri, decided to take their chances on Earth. Invaders (albeit secret invaders),they used the natural Gate to enter our world at E-Branch's Romanian "Refuge," a special hospice for traumatized orphans on the banks of the Danube at the junction of Romania, Bulgaria, and the former Yugoslavia.Slaughtering the Refuge's personnel and inmates, the trio split up, dispersing themselves abroad in the world ...Â <BR>E-Branch alone knew of the vampire invasion. Zek Föener, the love of Ben Trask's life, had died in the massacre at the Romanian Refuge; but in her final moments the telepath contacted Trask to tell him what was happening. Thus Trask was "with her" when she died--at which moment, in his grief of griefs, he had vowed revenge!But the rest of the world couldn't, mustn't be told. Else panic at the thought of an invisible, almost invincible plague loose among us would run riot. E-Branch's Minister Responsible must be told, however, and he gave the Branch carte blanche to track down and destroy the monsters out of Starside. Moreover, liaison with many of the world's great powers guaranteed their assistance, too, in the event that Trask's organization should need it. These were, of course, covert agreements; only the most tried and trusted leaders were privy to the facts, and then not to all the facts ...Â <BR>Some three years after the invasion, finally E-Branch "locators"--humanbloodhound trackers of men and monsters--picked up the "mindsmog" spoor of the Wamphyri in Western Australia's desolate Gibson Desert. But even as plans were made to counter the menace, so a timely quirk of synchronicity (not to mention the paradox of a once-familiar phenomenon) took place.Jake Cutter, a young man with a dubious record, had been incarcerated in a top-security Turin prison for certain acts of vengeance which in fact amounted to murder. But murder only insofar as the law's legal definition. For Jake had taken revenge on a gang of drug-running thugs and rapists--affiliates of the Russian Mafia--who had brutalized and murdered a woman of his intimate acquaintance.In answer to Jake's revenge serial killings, the leader of the gang--a mysterious Sicilian called Luigi Castellano--made arrangements to have Jake killed inside the prison. Learning of this, Jake had attempted to escape. But prison guards in Castellano's pay had opened fire on him as he scaled the prison wall. In which moment of extreme danger, there had come an astonishing intervention. At first Jake had thought that he'd been shot; he had actually seen the bullet--or the track of a golden bullet, or the coruscation of its ricochet, or something--strike home into his forehead. And then he had fallen, but not to the hard-packed earth of the prison's exercise yard.Instead Jake had "fallen" into the Möbius Continuum--and instantaneously more than five hundred miles through the Continuum--to Harry's Room at E-Branch HQ in London! Harry's Room, which decades earlier had provided accommodation for the original Necroscope during his brief tenure as prospective Head of Branch, and which Branch espers had since maintained in pristine condition.Simultaneous with Jake's appearance at E-Branch HQ, so the same espers--especially the locator David Chung--sensed that something of the Necroscope had returned. Trask, however, remembering what Harry had become before he quit Earth for Starside, could scarcely help but wonder what facet of him had come home. And Trask was also given to wonder: when Harry Keogh died, had his vampire been purged, or had it purged him ...?Â <BR>The three invaders from Starside are Lords Malinari and Szwart, and the female Vavara. Malinari "The Mind," a mentalist of phenomenal power; Lord Szwart, who is the very essence of darkness, a constantly mutating victim (and survivor) of his own metamorphic nature; and Vavara, whose hypnotic disguise is that of a beautiful woman when in fact she is a hag.When these Great Vampires came into our world they brought four lieutenant servitors with them, one of whom, Korath Mindsthrall (whose name identified him as being "in thrall" to Malinari the Mind), was sacrificed as a means of gaining entry to the Romanian Refuge.Thus when the vampire trio destroyed the Refuge, butchered its staff and inmates, and took new thralls before splitting up and venturing out into our world, Korath Mindsthrall's dead and broken body was left behind, pulped and drowned in a metal pipe in the shattered sump of the gutted Refuge. The true death for a vampire thrall whose ambitions were always above his station, or so Malinari had suspected.For Korath had been his man for long and long, and a great deal of Malinari had rubbed off on his lieutenant. Too much for his own good ...Â <BR>Meanwhile in the Möbius Continuum, some faint echo--some fragment, residual memory, ghost, or intelligence--of the Necroscope Harry Keogh had become aware of scarlet life-threads where they crossed the blue threads of men. One such blue life-thread was Jake Cutter's, and because of its prevalence in some future conflict, the Harry revenant traced it back to its source ... to Jake in the Turin prison, and indeed to the rigged jailbreak.But the revenant had its limitations; spread throughout all the Universes of Light, Harry's presence--his ability to effect changes in the mundane world of men--was at best tenuous. Also, his nature and Jake's were opposites in so many ways, and yet very much of a kind in so many others. And here he was, the very man, Jake Cutter himself--as unknown to the spirit of the ex-Necroscope as Harry was to him--about to die under the hammer blows of brutal bullets. But down future-time streams Harry had seen Jake's blue thread crossed by scarlet vampire threads, and the once-Necroscope knew for a fact that, "what will be has been," or that it would be. Wherefore Jake's life couldn't possibly end here. But how to save it?The answer came in a moment, but without Harry's instigation! A golden dart, one of his myriad familiars, striking home in Jake's head to enhance whatever there was of the metaphysical in a currently mundane mind. A dart of knowledge, yes, and a set of scrolling numbers--like a computer screen runningamok, conjuring the Möbius Continuum--which in its turn bore Jake to Harry's Room, at E-Branch HQ in London ...Â <BR>Australia, and Trask took Jake along for the ride. For whatever Trask's misgivings--and he of all men should know the truth of things--the rest of his espers saw Jake as a possible answer, and perhaps the only answer, to their needs: a weapon as powerful as anything the Wamphyri could bring to bear. But first, of course, he must accept what had happened and come to terms with it, learn to utilize the great gifts that he may have received, which as yet remained undeveloped in him.To which end and between times, when the Keogh revenant was able, it/ he spent time with Jake; usually in Jake's subconscious mind, his dreams, when he was relaxed and more receptive of esoteric knowledge. But just like Ben Trask, the ex-Necroscope found Jake obstinate, cynical, and frequently infuriating. For Jake had his own agenda, a certain Sicilian criminal called Luigi Castellano, and until that had been dealt with he knew he could never be his own man or anyone else's ...In the nighted, gurgling black sump of the ruined Romanian Refuge, Harry and Jake used deadspeak to talk to the sloughed-away Korath Mindsthrall where his polished bones clattered endlessly in the swirling water of a filtration conduit, and they learned the histories of Malinari, Szwart, and Vavara. And now the ex-Necroscope can only hope that in the waking world, Jake will remember what he learned in dreams.But here a problem:Despite Harry's warnings, Jake--of his own cognizance, his own free will--has agreed a pact with Korath, giving him limited access to his mind. For without the vampire he could never remember Harry's numbers, the formulae that conjure the Möbius Continuum. And without Jake, the dead but still dangerous--very dangerous--vampire can never stray from his watery grave.Together, however, they have the incredible mobility of the Möbius Continuum. Moreover, Korath (once Mindsthrall) now knows hope where no hope existed. Enabled, he can now begin scheming toward a suddenly feasible future ...Â <BR>On Australia's South Pacific coast, Trask and his team of espers have tracked down and attacked Lord Nephran Malinari in his casino aerie in the Macpherson Range of mountains; his lieutenants and various vampirized victims have been killed, destroyed utterly, but the Great Vampire himself has escaped.Jake Cutter played a major part in what measure of success E-Branch enjoyed; but aware of his compromised position--and alone in this knowledge, unable or unwilling to tell Trask and his espers about his "problem"--he can find little or no satisfaction in his newfound status within the organization.All Jake wanted was to be rid of a strange, unwelcome tenant: the ex-Necroscope, Harry, who had seemed intent on taking up partial (and perhaps even permanent?) residence in his head. But now that Harry has gone, a verydifferent and far more devious intruder has taken his place. Now, too, Jake finds himself plagued by Harry's warning: "Alive or dead makes no great difference. Never let a vampire into your mind!"As for Ben Trask: many of his concerns have been assuaged, but still there are questions that remain unanswered. Foremost among them: why Jake? Why has this problematic young man been chosen, apparently against his will, for work as important as this? Jake Cutter--spoiled as a child, unruly as a youth, and reckless as a man. Why him?And not only the Head of E-Branch, but the ex-Necroscope, too (in his immundane, incorporeal fashion), has wondered why. For those myriad attendant golden darts, revenant of his once-being, are apart from Harry and given to act of their own accord. He is the advance guard and scout, but they are the soldiers, the army. Thus it was with Jake: the ex-Necroscope found his life-thread, and so found him, but the dart struck home of its own cognizance. Why? Why was Jake chosen?Perhaps Harry should look to his own past for an answer, but in certain cases the past may be just as devious as the future. Even in a mind freed of bodily restraints there are bound to be blank spots, times and places that remain forever unremembered. And in the Necroscope's life entire years were lost like pages torn from a book.Perhaps the answer lies there ...Copyright © 2000 by Brian Lumley

A new novel in the best-selling vampire series fills in the life of the great vampire hunter, Harry Keogh, recounting Keogh's most perilous encounter with the undead while desperately searching for his missing wife and son.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>After a three-book sojourn in the mythical "Vampire World" of The Last Aerie (1994), Lumley's epic Necroscope saga returns to contemporary Europe for this ripping yarn of espionage and occult intrigue set during the years separating the second (Vamphyri!) and third (The Source) novels of the projected nine-volume series. British intelligence agent Harry Keogh, who can converse telepathically with the dead, appears here, younger and less experienced than when last seen. He has just vanquished Soviet vampire nemesis Boris Dragosani and learned how to travel through space and time, but his problems are only beginning. His wife and infant son disappear. For different reasons, both his colleagues at British intelligence and new acquaintance Bonnie Jean ("B.J.") Mirlu have used posthypnotic suggestion to prevent him from fully exploiting his extrasensory powers. With his usual aplomb, Lumley whips potentially confusing story elements into a fleet supernatural thriller that successfully prepares the Necroscope saga for a shift from its outdated Cold War setting to the current European political climate. In a literary landscape overpopulated with sympathetic soul-searching members of the Undead, Lumley's Necroscope novels are refreshing reminders that sometimes a vampire is just a bloody entertaining monster. <BR>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>The sixth volume of Lumley's vampire series, Necroscope, harks back to an earlier period in the life of Harry Keogh, who is the Necroscope. In it, Keogh is inexperienced, still on Earth, seeking his lost family, and caught in the murderous rivalry between two potent vampires. This set of ingredients produces a story that certainly succeeds at keeping the reader turning pages. Lumley hasn't quite dispensed with his tendency toward purple prose, however, and also, the book has the usual problem of the prequel--suspense that is undermined by the knowledge that the protagonist will survive, for his further adventures already exist. Yet wherever the other Necroscope yarns have been popular, this one will be, too. Roland Green

The twin sons of the Necroscope find new adventures as Nestor becomes a Vamphyri Lord and Nathan is trapped on Earth, trying to return to his own world to battle his evil twin. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Following Blood Brothers , the second volume of the Vampire World series revisits the twin sons of Harry Keogh, a British ESP agent who became a Wamphyri (vampire Lord) in the parallel vampire world of Sunside/Starside. Now one twin, Nestor, himself a Wamphyri of Starside, plots to destroy his brother Nathan, who still lives with their native tribe on Sunside. When one of Nestor's vampire lieutenants throws Nathan into the gate to hell, Nathan discovers that it's really a gate to Earth. On Earth, Nathan finds himself pursued by an evil Russian psychic, who needs Nathan's knowledge in order to invade the Vampire world. Once more the agents of British E-Branch, a top-secret parapsychological agency, step in, teaching Nathan to tap the awesome powers he inherited from his father. Lumley uses language deftly to conjure his alien universe, and both setting and characters are vivid and engaging. The encyclopedic scope of the saga stretches this seemingly transitional phase to the limits of interest, however. Since little compelling action occurs in the present, most of the novel reads like a summing up of the previous volume and a precursor to the great confrontation to come in the next. Still, fans of the Necroscope series and this Vampire World series will undoubtedly enjoy this adventure. <BR>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>Second novel in Lumley's Vampire World series (Blood Brothers, 1992), or subseries, but apparently seventh in the overall Necroscope series, each volume a doorstopper. Lumley hacks out his vampire universe with a plot of inhuman complexity that few could possibly keep straight--perhaps not even the author himself. Written in surreal impasto, his introductory synopsis is a crowded symbolist canvas whose weirdly lighted details escape a larger general meaning for new readers. At this point in the cycle, Nathan and Nestor, twin sons of Harry Keogh the Necroscope, a vampire hunter from a parallel vampire world who talks with the dead and zips swiftly through time and space, are now enemies in the Sunside/Starside world. Harry was an alien who sired his twins on Nana Kiklu of the Szgany Lidesci, but the twins have matured into opposites, with Nathan fey and gifted with weird power, and Nestor strong and lusty and now set on being lord of the Wamphyri (vampires)! We last saw Nestor snatched up by a flying monster, dropped into a land of lepers, then escaping, though into hideous dreams of the future, while his lieutenant Zahar had captured Nathan and tossed him into the Starside Gate, portal to hell-lands from which no man or monster had ever returned. Now Nathan is trapped on earth and being pursued by a maniacal psychic bent on murdering him, while a band of British psychics, who first became aware of the Keoghs back in 1990 (it's now 2006), protect him. Nestor, meanwhile, though a victim of nightmares, grows ever more vile in expanding his power, now torturing the dead (with whom he can talk in deadspeak), now raping girls while sucking them dry from within. Lumley's High Purple storytelling delirium remains undimmed. -- Copyright ©1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.

Nestor and Nathan Kiklu are twins, united by blood and by a psychic bond inherited from their father, Harry Keogh, the Necroscope. Once so close each knew when the other breathed, they have become the bitterest of enemies, divided by the terrible evil of the Wamphyri.<BR>Nestor, now a vampire Lord, rules a portion of the great tower known as the Last Aerie, from which he and the beautiful but deadly vampire Lady, Wratha the Risen, hunt the humans once defended by the Necroscope.<BR>Nathan, flung through the Gate to Earth, discovers that he shares not only Harry Keogh's ability to talk to the dead but his power to travel effortlessly and instantly through space and time. Joining forces with Britain's E-Branch, a super-secret organization of psychics, Nathan returns to the vampire world to save his people.<BR>Nathan desperately seeks a way to redeem his twin, but despite the solace he finds in the arms of his childhood sweetheart, knows his fight with Nestor must end in death - and the death of all the vampires. Blood - both living and undead - is spilled as Earthly weapons are brought to bear against the metamorphic alien Wamphyri.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Concluding the darkly hypnotic Vampire World trilogy (Blood Brothers; The Last Aerie), this red-blooded offering from British Fantasy Award-winner Lumley also brings to a close the epic narrative begun in Vampire World's prequel, the five-book Necroscope series. This installment relates the adventures of Nathan Keogh, a cross-dimensional traveler and telepath who speaks with the dead (hence his title of "Necroscope"). On orders from his vampiric twin brother, Nestor, Nathan is thrown to Earth through an interworld "Gate" out of the parallel world of Sunside/Starside, a planet inhabited by gypsies (Szgany) and desert-dwelling mystics (Thyre), as well as by a fascinating assemblage of shape-changing vampires (Wamphyri), thralls and hideous living/undead "constructs" formed in vile vats of percolating human and vampire fluids. Enter top-secret British and Russian psychic agents. The British psychic "E-Branch" sends Nathan and colleagues to join the Szgany to fight the vampires, who are embroiled in territorial wars ("bloodwars"). Meanwhile, Russia is concerned because its rogue E-Branch head has gone through the Gate with plans to seize control of all of Sunside/Starside-and then Earth. As climax piles on climax, Nathan, in addition to being the linchpin in the plans of the E-Branchers, the Szgany and the Thyre, becomes the prime target of the Wamphyri. Though this is the last of the trilogy, readers must hope that Lumley isn't really putting a stake through the heart of his vampire universe-which is so vivid, with characters to real, that even the undead seem alive. <BR>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.

The packed cruise ship is a terrific nesting ground for a Lord and Lady of the Wamphyri on the run from E-Branch and the new Necroscope, Jake Cutter. By the time the ship is reported missing, the few beings still living on board will no longer be human . . . and the Wamphyri will be long fled to their next conquest. <BR><BR>Korath, the vampire who lurks in Jake Cutter's mind, is determined to gain control of Jake's life, and Jake is equally determined not to let him have it. But to win this struggle Jake must confide in Ben Trask-and Trask, the head of E-Branch, is likely to want Jake dead the minute he learns of Jake's intrusive passenger! <BR><BR>The spore garden planted under London by the third Wamphyri, Lord Swartz, is bearing bitter fruit indeed as a mysterious sleeping sickness-with a vampiric taint-slowly spreads among the population of Great Britain.<BR><BR>E-Branch action teams have more on their plates than they can handle. They must locate terrorists who threaten the world with nuclear homicide; permanently close the Gate between the Wamphyri world and Earth; analyze the spore plague; and locate and destroy the three Wamphyri.<BR><BR>Even the powers of Harry Keogh, the original Necroscope, summoned from the Great Beyond via the combined powers of E-Branch's strongest agents, may not be enough to defeat the monsters who have brought Earth to the brink of total destruction.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>This new bottle can't disguise the aging wine of Lumley's Necroscope series or the increasingly stale bouquet of its last few installments. Set in a world where the vampire villains are resurrected as regularly as the cinematic Frankenstein's monster, and where the psychic hero is forever channeling the thoughts of dead characters from previous episodes, this expansive 13th novel is distinguished mostly by its sense of dÂjÂ vu. The story picks up right after events in Necroscope: Defilers (2000) with the revelation that vampires Nephran Malinari, the Lady Vavara and Lord Szwart are still at large, despite the efforts of Ben Trask's E-Branch operatives to wipe them out in Greece. The ESPionage agents chase the elusive vampires through Turkey, trying to prevent them from seeding the world with spores of virulent vampire fungi. Jake Cutter, neophyte Necroscope (someone who can converse with the dead), remains mostly on the periphery, still wrestling with a personal vampire taint that makes him resemble more and more the similarly infected first Necroscope, Harry Keogh. Once again troubles at Russia's interdimensional Perchorsk Gate, which opens to the vampire universe, add to the mess. Lumley still excels at depicting heroes larger than life and horrors worse than death, but his rehash of earlier intrigues and plot twists bogs the tale down. The exciting pyrotechnic finale appears to bring resolution to some long-running subplots, but also calls attention to how often this novel coasts when it could explode. <BR><BR>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc. <BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Jake Cutter, the newest member of E-Branch, tackles the latest development of the secret war against a trio of extra-dimensional Wamphyri as he tracks down the source of a deadly plague that transforms its sleeping victims into inhuman monsters. Lumley's conclusion to a trilogy that includes Necroscope: Invaders and Necroscope: Defilers features scenes of graphic horror, fast-paced action, and political intrigue. A good addition to most horror collections. <BR>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Jake Cutter, the newest member of E-Branch, tackles the latest development of the secret war against a trio of extra-dimensional Wamphyri as he tracks down the source of a deadly plague that transforms its sleeping victims into inhuman monsters.

Lord Malinari and Lady Vavara reappear by turning a cruise ship into a bloody battleground, while Lord Swartz has perfected his spores that turn vampirism into an even more infectious and lethal disease. At a more mundane level, one of E-Branch's stalwart allies, the Russian mindspy Gustav Turchin, has to fight to close the Russian gate between Earth and the Wamphyri home world while dealing with stolen nuclear weapons in the hands of renegade Communists. Lumley's prose and pacing are more polished in each new book, and he continues to combine horror and alien-invasion themes uncommonly deftly. He skillfully handles the shipboard scenes, the possible influence of Russian politics on supernatural intrigues, and the use of precognition. Definitely a good conclusion to Lumley's hybrid saga.

Having split up following their covert "invasion," the trio went their own ways. Lord Nephran Malinari ("Malinari the Mind") enthralled an Australian billionaire to set himself up in a casino aerie in the exclusive resort of Xanadu in the Macpherson Range. Lord Szwart, a metamorphic "fly-the-light" in the truest sense of the term, headed for London, settling in a forgotten Roman "temple" in the deepest, most inaccessible bowels of the city. And Vavara--"beautiful" mistress of mass hypnotism--defiled an order of nuns by infiltrating their fortresslike monastery on the Greek island of Krassos.<BR><BR>Their plan to overthrow the planet, reducing it to a vampire paradise, was in essence a simple one: to plant gardens of deadspawn fungi and bring them to deadly maturity. Nurtured on the life fluids (the mutated DNA) of sacrificed vampire thralls or lieutenants, these toadstools when they ripened and spawned would release a myriad of spores into the Earth's atmosphere, to be breathed by an unwitting human race! Then, as men became blood-lusting monsters who hid from the sun during daylight hours and hunted by night, and nation fought nation as the world sank into chaos, and no one--least of all the mazed, blood-addicted victims--was able to understand or even consider fighting the incurable "disease" that was converting them...then the Great Vampires, the Wamphyri, would emerge from the shadows and come into their own.<BR><BR>As in the earliest days of their predawn Vampire World of Sunside/Starside, their thralls and lieutenants would go abroad in the world, carrying their monstrous plague with them as they consolidated their masters' (and mistress's) territories, where the laws of the Wamphyri would be the only laws. Malinari would take Australia, expanding into all the islands around and eventually Asia, and Vavara would take the Mediterranean and Africa, spreading east to form a border with Malinari. As for the metamorphic horror that was Lord Szwart: while it would seem he had been disadvantaged, with only the British Isles, France, Spain, and the northern and westernmost regions of Europe coming under his control, as he deployed his forces west across the Atlantic, he would quickly seed the Americas with his deadspawn, and when the time was ripe he would move his power base to New York. The metropolis's sprawling underground network would provide access to all parts of the city whether in daylight or darkness, while its greatest building would be Szwart's aerie, its every window lacquered black and draped against the sun.<BR><BR>These had been the ambitions of the Wamphyri, and they had seemed infallible; their dreams, and an unwitting mankind's as yet unrealized nightmares. But despite their legendary cunning and leechlike tenacity, the three Great Vampires had not reckoned with E-Branch.<BR><BR>E-Branch (E for ESP): a top-secret arm of the British intelligence services, many of whose psychically talented agents had dealt with vampires before, and not only in this world but also in Sunside/Starside. Ben Trask, the members of his London-based organization, and a small handful of people in the Corridors of Power were the only human beings who knew of the alien invasion. And because of the planetwide panic any disclosure would cause, they didn't dare speak of it to anyone outside their circle.<BR><BR>But having traced Malinari to Australia (and with the ever-grudging assistance of their Minister Responsible in Whitehall: his help in covertly informing an Australian counterpart of the problem and enlisting military aid), Trask and an E-Branch task force had ventured down under to confront Malinari in his aerie. There in Xanadu they had destroyed his fungi garden (though not without the timely assistance of Jake Cutter, a young man whose extraordinary powers were not yet fully developed or even understood) but The Mind himself had escaped.<BR><BR>As for Jake Cutter (though more especially from Ben Trask's necessarily cautious point of view):<BR><BR>Jake seems an entirely wrongheaded man with something of a chequered background. Having fallen foul of a gang of international drug-runners and suffering at their hands, he was bent on settling old scores when strange circumstances brought him into contact with E-Branch. (He was in fact pursuing a vendetta with this criminal organization's powerful leader and several of his close colleagues--people who had raped and murdered a girl of Jake's acquaintance, with whom he had had a brief but passionate affair--and had been responsible for a series of violent, extremely ugly deaths in their higher echelon.)<BR><BR>But the leader of the gang--a Sicilian vampire named Luigi Castellano--had laid a trap for Jake, causing him to fall into the hands of the Italian police. Incarcerated in a Turin prison, Jake had soon discovered that Castellano was not without influence there, and that Jake's demise had been scheduled for the very near future.<BR><BR>Then, during a jailbreak (also arranged by Castellano), when it seemed certain that Jake must die under fire from the guards...a weird reprieve, a miraculous escape: Jake's first taste of things to come, and the beginning of his transition.<BR><BR>Something he took to be a ricochetting bullet--a flash of golden fire--struck him in the forehead. But instead of falling dead he fell into something else entirely and was conveyed through the Möbius Continuum (a means of metaphysical teleportation) to Harry's Room at E-Branch HQ in London.<BR><BR>Harry's Room:<BR><BR>The long-dead (?) Necroscope Harry Keogh was once the most important member of E-Branch. On those occasions when he stayed at the London HQ, he had a room of his own, as did many espers. Harry's Room, however, has always been (and still is) different from other rooms. Perhaps to signal their regard for their much loved, highly respected ex-member--or perhaps because the room continues to retain something of the Necroscope's personality--it has been left untouched and unoccupied, exactly as it was in the time of Harry's residence.<BR><BR>And so it was a singular event for Ben Trask and his espers to discover a bewildered stranger inside the locked room of the Necroscope, in the heart of security-conscious E-Branch HQ! And it had to be more than a mere coincidence...<BR><BR>Jake's advent had come at a propitious moment (or at least, everyone except Trask thought so), for it was only a short time later that Nephran Malinari was discovered in Xanadu, his playboy retreat and aerie in the mountains of the Macpherson Range. And teaming Jake up with Liz Merrick, a young, attractive, budding telepathic receiver whose powers, like Jake's, were still developing, Trask took them to Australia as part of his task force.<BR><BR>It was during the course of this largely successful operation that Jake discovered the truth of what Trask and his people had suspected all along: that indeed he had inherited something of Harry's powers. For when the original Necroscope had died on Starside, his metaphysical personality--the sidereal intelligence that was Harry--had fragmented into many golden splinters or darts, one of which had entered into Jake! Now in his dreams Jake could converse with the "dead" Necroscope through the medium of deadspeak. Then, too (not yet aware that his dreams were of crucial importance, that they had real meaning in the waking world and were much more than disturbing symptoms of paramnesia and a crumbling mentality), Jake had felt obliged to ask Trask just what, exactly, a Necroscope was.<BR><BR>But while Trask had been willing to explain something of a Necroscope's powers to Jake--his ability to teleport, and the unearthly "gift" which enabled him to converse with the dead--there were certain other things that he dared not speak of. For as the director of E-Branch for many years, Trask had developed an enquiring and skeptical mind; he knew how very deceiving outward appearances can be, and how even the most innocent seeming of men (especially the innocent ones: for example, the original Necroscope) may be susceptible to the greatest evils. Moreover, Trask had never had much faith in coincidence or synchronicity. He believed that things usually had good reasons for happening, and that when they happened might be equally relevant...<BR><BR>Jake had come on the scene at a propitious time, certainly--but for whom? And wasn't it simply too much of a coincidence that at the advent of a trio of Great Vampires out of Starside, a new Necroscope should also put in an appearance? So, had Jake arrived of his own (or Harry Keogh's) accord, by "coincidence," or had he in fact been sent to infiltrate E-Branch? What was it of the original Necroscope--how much of Harry, what element--had entered Jake? Something of his light side, from his earlier life, or something of his far more dangerous side from a later, darker period?<BR><BR>For one of the several things that Jake didn't yet know was that at the end of the Necroscope's time on Earth he had been a vampire in his own right--Wamphyri! And probably the greatest of them all! And not only Harry but two of his sons: they, too, had been vampires, changeling creatures, on Starside in a weird parallel world...<BR><BR>Thus Trask's doubts--or more properly his natural caution, coupled with his inability to read the young Necroscope despite that his own weird talent made him a human lie detector--held him back from bringing Jake more fully into his confidence. For if Jake was not the real thing, if he had not inherited Harry's mantle to become the fantastic weapon against the Wamphyri that most of Trask's agents believed him to be, but rather possessed the potential to become the exact opposite...then Trask might yet have to kill him!<BR><BR>Hence his great quandary, for if on the other hand Jake was the real thing, and if he was made privy to everything, then he might easily shy from the knowledge--the full knowledge--of what he was becoming and what he would be capable of doing, and would be lost to E-Branch forever. For while it takes a special kind of man to accept the responsibilities of a Necroscope, the role of caretaker to the dead, it takes an extra special man to accept that the Great Majority will do almost anything for love of him...including the agony and horror of self-resurrection, of rising from their graves in order to protect him!<BR><BR>After the Australian venture, when Jake was given the comparative "freedom" of E-branch HQ--if not access to all of its many secrets--the first thing he did was desert the cause in order to pursue his own agenda: his vendetta with Castellano. But the fact was that Jake didn't see his leaving as any kind of treachery; his reasons for walking out on Ben Trask and E-Branch were more than one, and not least self-preservation.<BR><BR>First, the Harry Keogh influence had been replaced by something of a far more disturbing nature: Jake was finding himself under constant attack from a deceased vampire lieutenant called Korath (once Korath Mindsthrall), an ex-minion of Malinari. Dead and sloughed away in a subterranean sump in Romania, Korath had used deadspeak to tell Jake the histories of the three Wamphyri invaders from Starside--but in the process he had also tricked his way into semiresidence in Jake's head. Only let Jake relax and let his mental shields down, Korath would be there with him in his mind, dreaming his dreams, conversing with him, attempting to influence--to "guide" or "advise" him--and generally sharing his waking world experiences. Jake could send him away, back to his sump, but he could never be absolutely certain when Korath was or wasn't there.<BR><BR>The only good thing to come out of this was that Korath had "inherited" something of his former master's mentalism; endowed with eidetic recall, he'd memorized the mathematical Möbius formula given to Jake by Harry Keogh--which for some reason Jake was unable to grasp--and had thus become his reluctant host's one and only key to the metaphysical Möbius Continuum's mode of trans- or teleportation.<BR><BR>And so he and Jake had worked out a compromise. All Korath wanted--or so he had led Jake to believe--was revenge on his former master and the other Great Vampires for killing him as a means of accessing our world. But since Korath was incorporeal, a dead creature whose sole contact with the living was through Jake and his deadspeak, the new Necroscope was the only one who could possibly exact such a revenge. Jake couldn't go about his business without Korath, and Korath would have no existence at all without Jake.<BR><BR>One other problem with Korath: if Ben Trask found out about his coexistence with Jake, it might yet be a case of having to kill two birds with one stone--or more properly one man and a parasitic mind-thing with however many bullets were required to do the job.<BR><BR>But even that, self-preservation, wasn't Jake's only reason for quitting the Branch. In fact he was driven to leave by some unknown but increasingly insistent force which demanded that he pursue his own--or perhaps someone else's?--agenda. Moreover, the longer he remained with E-Branch, the greater the chance of a romantic attachment to Liz Merrick, with whom he'd developed a semitelepathic rapport. The last thing Jake needed was to be close to someone he couldn't touch for fear of a dead vampire's voyeurism!<BR><BR>In Jake's absence, while he used the Möbius Continuum to pursue and harass Luigi Castellano's Mediterranean-based drug-runners, E-Branch had tracked down Malinari and Vavara to the tiny Greek island of Krassos. This time, as distinct from the Australian operation, Trask's task force was a very small one, and politically and economically (even climatically, in an El Niño year), there were huge problems to be overcome. But with the help of a Greek friend of theirs from an earlier adventure--an Athenian police inspector called Manolis Papastamos--finally E-Branch located and burned Vavara's monastery aerie, while her deadspawn garden was dynamited and buried in a series of explosive attacks.<BR><BR>But at the same time there had been two major setbacks. In London, Ben Trask's newfound love of only a few days' duration, the telepath Millicent Cleary, had been kidnapped by Szwart and his minions down into his Roman temple dedicated to dark gods in a forgotten cavern deep under the city. And in Krassos, Liz Merrick had been taken by Vavara when that mistress of evil made her escape from the blazing monastery. It had looked like the end for both of these brave women. But:<BR><BR>In Sicily, where Jake had finally rid the world of Castellano and his organization--and in the process discovered why he had felt so driven by his vendetta: that this had been part of a task begun but left unfinished, even unremembered, by the original Necroscope--the new Necroscope "heard" Liz's desperate cry for help. Across all the many miles between them, Jake heard it. It was the rapport which existed between them, which had boosted Liz's developing telepathic talent.<BR><BR>But when Jake required Korath to show him the Möbius equations in order that he might use the Continuum to find Liz and rescue her...then Korath had sprung his trap!<BR><BR>Korath had already discovered that Jake couldn't be bribed or threatened when his own life was at stake, for without Jake there would be no Korath; so whatever else the vampire did, he would try to keep his host alive. But Jake would definitely be open to persuasion if another's life were at risk...and more especially if that other was the woman he loved. Now Jake knew Korath's real objective: access to his inner mind--to be one with him, a part of him--and perhaps permanently!<BR><BR>Jake couldn't refuse...<BR><BR>Without Korath's help, Liz was as good as dead...<BR><BR>In order to view the equations, create a Möbius door, teleport through the Continuum and rescue Liz, he must first accept this dead but incredibly dangerous thing's conditions. And this despite Harry Keogh's warning: that he must never let a vampire into his mind...<BR><BR>But there was no longer any other way...<BR><BR>He went along with it, gave Korath access to the very core of his mind and welcomed him in "of his own free will"...and only then discovered how he had been duped, that he would have been able to conjure the formula all along--if Korath had not been blocking his every attempt!<BR><BR>Too late now, though, to do anything about it, for Liz was in trouble on a small Greek island hundreds of miles away...<BR><BR>Jake was in the nick of time. In Krassos, he reunited Liz with her E-Branch colleagues, who then informed him of the plight of the telepath Millie Cleary in London. Using the Continuum, Jake returned Trask and company to their London HQ, where the espers combined their weird talents to locate Millie. Still alive, her psychic aura was well known to Liz who was then able to contact her and determine her precise whereabouts. Now it was up to the new Necroscope.<BR><BR>Taking Millie's coordinates from Liz's mind, Jake "went" to the distraught telepath in her previously unknown temple prison. There he found not only Millie, but also Lord Szwart's terrible deadspawn garden, which (after a nightmarish confrontation with the "Lord of Darkness" himself) he managed to destroy by bringing about an explosion of natural gas.<BR><BR>So now, and despite that the plans of the Wamphyri were in disarray, the main question had to be: how many of the invaders themselves had survived? Had Vavara died when her limo crashed, throwing her into the sea? Had Malinari been trapped below, in Vavara's garden, when it was buried? Had the metamorphic Szwart suffered the true death in a Roman temple whose destruction had even registered on the seismographs at Greenwich?<BR><BR>Now, too, with Ben Trask and his people in Jake's debt, it was time for a showdown. Time for Jake to give up his secret--the fact that he harboured a vampire intelligence in his mind--and ask for E-Branch's help, but also time for him to demand to know the full story: why had Trask been so reticent in his dealings with him, and what had been the problem with the previous Necroscope that the Head of Branch hadn't dared talk about it?<BR><BR>Harry Keogh's ability to raise the dead? But Jake had found that out for himself; indeed, it accounted for the grey streaks at his temples, and the hint of fearful, forbidden knowledge in his eyes. But he knew that wasn't the entire story. Perhaps one day the teeming dead--that Great Majority of human souls gone before--might believe in Jake, have enough faith in him that he could ask them, but for now he was asking Ben Trask.<BR><BR>Or he would have been.<BR><BR>But at a meeting in Trask's office, when all Jake's questions might finally have been answered:<BR><BR>An urgent message from the Minister Responsible: something had come up which he knew would "interest" E-Branch. His usual British understatement, for in fact the minister knew that it was something which only E-Branch could handle.<BR><BR>And now read on...

Harry Keough, aka the Necroscope, has always considered himself a master of the Mobius Continuum--a dimension existing parallel to all space and time and his personal instantaneous gateway to anywhere in the multiverse. But this is hardly overweening conceit on Harry's part, for to his knowledge he is not unique; two other intelligences, with powers similar to his, do indeed exist. One such is the long-dead August Ferdinand Mobius himself, the German astronomer, mathematician, and discoverer of the eponymous Mobius Strip which led him to explore, posthumously, his previously conjectural Continuum; and the other is Harry s son, who has not only inherited his father's mathematical skill but also the metaphysical talent by means of which the Necroscope converses with dead people in their graves!<BR><BR>Picture Harry's confusion, then, on returning home via the Mobius Continuum from an adventure in Las Vegas, as he witnesses however briefly a flailing figure hurtling conscious but uncontrolled through the endless midnight of the Continuum.

The silence of the grave is not silent at all. In their millions, the dead are screaming...but no one can hear them! Atop a perilous cliff, deep in the Balkan mountains, rises the castle of the Ferenczy. Once it was a stronghold of the Vamphyri...and now it will be so again, for Janos Ferenczy, vampire and black magician, has risen from his ages-long sleep. Powerful and evil, Janos conjures dead men and women into a semblance of life and subjects them to fiendish tortures. But the shrieks of the dead do not satisfy Janos's lust for blood--for that he needs living humans. His terrifying armies of the risen dead will soon overwhelm a helpless, defenseless mankind... Helpless and defenseless because a terrible battle against the vampires has destroyed Harry Keogh's deadspeak, leaving the Necroscope deaf to the teeming dead...and to their warnings of Janos's reign of terror. To save the world, Harry must join forces and link minds with the most powerful, and deadliest, vampire of all!

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Classic Lovecraftian horror from one of the masters of the form, British Fantasy Award-winner Brian Lumley. <BR><BR>Tarra Khash is a Hrossak, a barbarian from the steppes beyond the River Luhr. A fearless adventurer, Tarra roves Theem-hdra in search of his next fortune, his next drink, and warm, willing females to share his bed. The Hrossak is a most fortunate man, for he has faced more than one god during his travels, and so far escaped unscathed . . . .<BR><BR>Seeking to avenge the murder of a beautiful young woman of the half-mystical Suhm-yi, Tarra joins forces with her husband, now the last of his kind. Each worships a moon-god, and together, their faith and Tarra's weapons wreak a terrible vengeance on those who stole the treasure of the Suhm-yi and destroyed that noble race. <BR><BR>Eager for wealth, Tarra is trapped by a wily old man who has lured him into plumbing the depths of a treasure-filled cavern guarded by golden statues of the Great God Cthulhu. Cthulhu's treasure is not easily plundered, and Tarra nearly loses his life to the monstrous forces of the Elder God. <BR><BR>Many men have met the lamia Orbiquita, but none have lived to tell of her extraordinary powers of love-making--until Tarra Khash, who treats her as a woman wants to be treated and so earns her forgiveness and his life. Alas, others who assume her to be weakened by love for Tarra Khash are not so lucky!<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Brian Lumley is the author of the bestselling Necroscope series of vampire novels. The first Necroscope, Harry Keogh, also appears in a collection of Lumley's short fiction, Harry Keogh and Other Weird Heroes, along Titus Crow and Henri Laurent de Marigny, from Titus Crow, Volumes One, Two, and Three, and David Hero and Eldin the Wanderer, from the Dreamlands series. <BR><BR>An acknowledged master of Lovecraft-style horror, Brian Lumley has won the British Fantasy Award and been named a Grand Master of Horror. His works have been published in more than a dozen countries and have inspired comic books, role-playing games, and sculpture, and been adapted for television.<BR><BR>When not writing, Lumley can often be found spear-fishing in the Greek islands, gambling in Las Vegas, or attending a convention somewhere in the US.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Harry Keogh is moving on. Though the search for his missing wife and child continues, his heart now lies in Edinburgh with Bonnie Jean--a beautiful Scottish werewolf whose friendly pack and flourishing pub have given him a place he can almost call home.But from the rocky heights of Sicily, the diabolical Francezci brothers plot the wolf-pack's destruction; and down in the terrible Pit beneath Le Manse Madonie, an ancient evil schemes.The vampires conspire. They reach a decision. They choose a vector. Mafia thug Mike Milazzo is no good to anyone, anytime, anywhere&#x20ac;¦which makes him perfect. Disposable.The brothers infect him with a deadly poison--an engineered plague that even a werewolf could never survive--and they offer him a terrible bargain: successfully contaminate the wolf-pack, and receive the antidote. Fail, and die!Mike has everything to lose. So does Harry Keogh. But the Necroscope lost everything once before, and he isn't about to do it aga<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly:<BR><BR>Lumley reveals perhaps more than he intended to in the note following this turgid supernatural novella, originally intended to be a chapter in his 1995 two-part novel, The Lost Years. Having promised his publisher a vampire tale, Lumley remembered a story line he had previously thought superfluous and decided to write it after all. The convoluted plot, in which the Francezci brothers recruit American mobster and vampire Mike Milazzo as a weapon against Harry Keogh, a necroscope who can communicate with the dead, will leave many readers wishing the author had left it on the cutting-room floor. The writing is often clumsy (Harry knew that their moon-child nature caused little more than a trace of the telepathic phenomenon known by E-Branch's mentalists as mindsmog), and the story will make sense only to Lumley's longtime fans.

From the New York Times bestselling author of My Share of the Task and Leaders, a manual for leaders looking to make their teams more adaptable, agile, and unified in the midst of change. <BR><BR>When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in 2004, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. Al Qaeda in Iraq was a decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the local population. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training--but none of that seemed to matter. To defeat Al Qaeda, they would have to combine the power of the world's mightiest military with the agility of the world's most fearsome terrorist network. They would have to become a "team of teams"--faster, flatter, and more flexible than ever.<BR><BR>In Team of Teams, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be rel­evant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and or­ganizations today. In periods of unprecedented crisis, leaders need practical management practices that can scale to thousands of people--and fast. By giving small groups the freedom to experiment and share what they learn across the entire organiza­tion, teams can respond more quickly, communicate more freely, and make better and faster decisions. <BR><BR>Drawing on compelling examples--from NASA to hospital emergency rooms--Team of Teams makes the case for merging the power of a large corporation with the agility of a small team to transform any organization.

The stunning story of one of America's great disasters, a preventable tragedy of Gilded Age America, brilliantly told by master historian David McCullough.<BR><BR>At the end of the nineteenth century, Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was a booming coal-and-steel town filled with hardworking families striving for a piece of the nation's burgeoning industrial prosperity. In the mountains above Johnstown, an old earth dam had been hastily rebuilt to create a lake for an exclusive summer resort patronized by the tycoons of that same industrial prosperity, among them Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Andrew Mellon. Despite repeated warnings of possible danger, nothing was done about the dam. Then came May 31, 1889, when the dam burst, sending a wall of water thundering down the mountain, smashing through Johnstown, and killing more than 2,000 people. It was a tragedy that became a national scandal.<BR><BR>Graced by David McCullough's remarkable gift for writing richly textured, sympathetic social history, The Johnstown Flood is an absorbing, classic portrait of life in nineteenth-century America, of overweening confidence, of energy, and of tragedy. It also offers a powerful historical lesson for our century and all times: the danger of assuming that because people are in positions of responsibility they are necessarily behaving responsibly.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>The history of civil engineering may sound boring, but in David McCullough's hands it is, well, riveting. His award-winning histories of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Panama Canal were preceded by this account of the disastrous dam failure that drowned Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1889. Written while the last survivors of the flood were still alive, McCullough's narrative weaves the stories of the town, the wealthy men who owned the dam, and the forces of nature into a seamless whole. His account is unforgettable: "The wave kept on coming straight toward him, heading for the very heart of the city. Stores, houses, trees, everything was going down in front of it, and the closer it came, the bigger it seemed to grow.... The height of the wall of water was at least thirty-six feet at the center.... The drowning and devastation of the city took just about ten minutes." A powerful, definitive book, and a tribute to the thousands who died in America's worst inland flood. --Mary Ellen Curtin<BR><BR>Review<BR>The New Yorker A first rate example of the documentary method....Mr. McCullough is a good writer and painstaking reporter and he has re-created that now almost mythic cataclysm...with the thoroughness the subject demands.<BR><BR>Book World McCullough has resurrected the flood for a generation that may know it in name only. He proves the subject is still fresh and spectacular.<BR><BR>John Leonard The New York Times We have no better social historian.<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>David McCullough (1933-2022) twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for Truman and John Adams, and twice received the National Book Award, for The Path Between the Seas and Mornings on Horseback. His other acclaimed books include The Johnstown Flood, The Great Bridge, Brave Companions, 1776, The Greater Journey, The American Spirit, The Wright Brothers, and The Pioneers. He was the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.

All rights reserved.<BR>Chapter 1<BR><BR>The sky was red<BR><BR>Again that morning there had been a bright frost in the hollow below the dam, and the sun was not up long before storm clouds rolled in from the southeast.<BR><BR>By late afternoon a sharp, gusty wind was blowing down from the mountains, flattening the long grass along the lakeshore and kicking up tiny whitecaps out in the center of the lake. The big oaks and giant hemlocks, the hickories and black birch and sugar maples that crowded the hillside behind the summer colony began tossing back and forth, creaking and groaning. Broken branches and young leaves whipped through the air, and at the immense frame clubhouse that stood at the water's edge, halfway among the cottages, blue wood smoke trailed from great brick chimneys and vanished in fast swirls, almost as though the whole building, like a splendid yellow ark, were under steam, heading into the wind.<BR><BR>The colony was known as the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. It was a private summer resort located on the western shore of a mountain lake in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, about halfway between the crest of the Allegheny range and the city of Johnstown. On the afternoon of Thursday, May 30, Memorial Day, 1889, the club was not quite ten years old, but with its gaily painted buildings, its neat lawns and well-tended flower beds, it looked spanking new and, in the gray, stormy half-light, slightly out of season.<BR><BR>In three weeks, when the summer season was to start, something like 200 guests were expected. Now the place looked practically deserted. The only people about were a few employees who lived at the clubhouse and some half dozen members who had come up from Pittsburgh for the holiday. D. W. C. Bidwell was there; so were the young Clarke brothers, J. J. Lawrence, and several of the Sheas and Irwins. Every now and then a cottage door slammed, voices called back and forth from the boathouses. Then there would be silence again, except for the sound of the wind.<BR><BR>Sometime not long after dark, it may have been about eight thirty, a young man stepped out onto the long front porch at the clubhouse and walked to the railing to take a look at the weather. His name was John G. Parke, Jr. He was clean-shaven, slight of build, and rather aristocratic-looking. He was the nephew and namesake of General John G. Parke, then superintendent of West Point. But young Parke was a rare item in his own right for that part of the country; he was a college man, having finished three years of civil engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. For the present he was employed by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club as the so-called "resident engineer." He had been on the job just short of three months, seeing to general repairs, looking after the dam, and supervising a crew of some twenty Italian laborers who had been hired to install a new indoor plumbing system, and who were now camped out of sight, back in the woods.<BR><BR>In the pitch dark he could hardly see a thing, so he stepped down the porch stairs and went a short distance along the boardwalk that led through the trees to the cottages. The walk, he noticed, was slightly damp. Apparently, a fine rain had fallen sometime while he was inside having his supper. He also noticed that though the wind was still up, the sky overhead was not so dark as before; indeed, it seemed to be clearing off some. This was not what he had expected. Windstorms on the mountain nearly always meant a heavy downpour almost immediately after -- "thunder-gusts" the local men called them. Parke had been through several already in the time he had been at the lake and knew what to expect.<BR>par<BR><BR>It would be as though the whole sky were laying siege to the burly landscape. The rain would drum down like an unyielding river. Lightning would flash blue-white, again and again across the sky, and thunderclaps would boom back and forth down the valley like a cannonade, rattling every window along the lakeshore.<BR><BR>Then, almost as suddenly as it had started, the siege would lift, and silent, milky steam would rise from the surface of the water and the rank smell of the sodden forest floor would hang on in the air for hours.<BR><BR>Tonight, however, it appeared there was to be no storm. Parke turned and walked back inside. About nine-thirty he went upstairs, climbed into bed, and went to deep.<BR><BR>About an hour and a half later, very near eleven, the rain began. It came damming through the blackness in huge wind-driven sheets, beating against the clubhouse, the tossing trees, the lake, and the dark, untamed country that stretched off in every direction for miles and miles.<BR><BR>The storm had started out of Kansas and Nebraska, two days before, on May 28. The following day there had been hard rains in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Trains had been delayed, roads washed out. In Kansas, along the Cottonwood River, a dozen farms had been flattened by tornado-force winds and several people had been killed. In northern Michigan and parts of Indiana there had been sudden snow squalls. Warnings had been telegraphed east. On the night of the 29th the U.S. Signal Service issued notices that the Middle Atlantic states were in for severe local storms. On the morning of May 30 all stations in the area reported "threatening weather."<BR><BR>When the storm struck western Pennsylvania it was the worst downpour that had ever been recorded for that section of the country. The Signal Service called it the most extensive rainfall of the century for so large an area and estimated that from six to eight inches of rain fell in twenty-four hours over nearly the entire central section. On the mountains there were places where the fall was ten inches.<BR><BR>But, at the same time, there were astonishing disparities between the amount of rainfall at places within less than a hundred-mile radius. At the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, for example, a pail left outside overnight would have five inches of water in it the next morning when the rain was still coming down. The total rainfall at the clubhouse would be somewhere near seven inches. In Pittsburgh, just sixty-five miles to the west as the crow flies, the total rainfall would be only one and a half inches.<BR><BR>But as the storm beat down on the mountain that night, John G. Parke, Jr., who would turn twenty-three in less than a month, slept on, never hearing a thing.<BR><BR>Most of the holiday crowds were back from the cemetery by the time the rain began Thursday afternoon. It had been the customary sort of Memorial Day in Johnstown, despite the weather.<BR><BR>People had been gathering along Main Street since noon. With the stores closed until six, with school out, and the men off from the mills, it looked as though the whole town was turning out. Visitors were everywhere, in by special trains from Somerset, Altoona, and other neighboring towns. The Ancient Order of Hibernians, "a stalwart, vigorous looking body of men," as the Johnstown Tribune described them, was stopping over for its annual state convention. Hotels were full and the forty-odd saloons in Johnstown proper were doing a brisk business.<BR><BR>The Reverend H. L. Chapman, who lived two doors off Main, in the new Methodist parsonage facing the park, later wrote, "The morning was delightful, the city was in its gayest mood, with flags, banners and flowers everywhere...we could see almost everything of interest from our porch. The streets were more crowded than we had ever seen before."<BR><BR>The parade, late starting as always, got under way about two-thirty, marched up Main, past the Morrell place, on by the Presbyterian Church and the park, clear to Bedford Street. There it turned south and headed out along the river to Sandy Vale, where the war dead were buried. The fire department marched, the Morrellville Odd Fellows, the Austrian Music Society, the Hornerstown Drum Corps, the Grand Army Veterans, and the Sons of Veterans, and half a dozen or more other groups of various shapes and sizes, every one of them getting a big cheer, and especially the Grand Army men, several of whom were beginning to look as though the three-mile tramp was a little more than they were up to.<BR><BR>How much things had changed since they had marched off to save the Union! It had been nearly thirty years since Lincoln had first called for volunteers. Grant and Lee were both dead, and there were strapping steelworkers with thick, black mustaches standing among the crowds along Main Street who had been born since Appomattox.<BR><BR>At the start of the war Johnstown had been no more than a third the size it was now; and ten years before that, it had been nothing but a sleepy little canal town with elderbushes growing high along Main, and so quiet you could hear the boat horns before the barges cleared the bend below town.<BR><BR>But ever since the war, with the west opening up, the Cambria Iron Company had had its giant three-ton converters going night and day making steel for rails and barbed wire, plowshares, track bolts, and spring teeth for harrows. The valley was full of smoke, and the city clanked and whistled and rumbled loud enough to be heard from miles off. At night the sky gleamed so red it looked as though the whole valley were on fire. James Quinn, one of Johnstown's most distinguished-looking Grand Army veterans and its leading dry-goods merchant, enjoyed few sights more. "The sure sign of prosperity," he called it.<BR><BR>Years after, Charlie Schwab, the most flamboyant of Carnegie's men, described the view of Johnstown from his boyhood home in the mountain town of Loretto, nearly twenty miles to the northeast.<BR><BR>"Along toward dusk tongues of flame would shoot up in the pall around Johnstown. When some furnace door was opened the evening turned red. A boy watching from the rim of hills had a vast arena before him, a place of vague forms, great labors, and dancing fires. And the murk always present, the smell of the foundry. It gets into your hair, your clothes, even your blood."<BR><BR>Most of the men watching the parade that Memorial Day would have taken a somewhat less romantic view. In the rolling mills they worked under intense heat on slippery iron floors where molten metal went tearing by and one false step or slow reaction could mean horrible accidents. Most of them worked a ten- or even twelve-hour day, six days a week, and many weeks they worked the hated "long turn," which meant all day Sunday and on into Monday. If they got ten dollars for a week's work they were doing well.<BR><BR>A visiting journalist in 1885 described Johnstown as "new, rough, and busy, with the rush of huge mills and factories and the throb of perpetually passing trains." The mills were set just below town in the gap in the mountains where the Conemaugh River flows westward. On the hillside close to the mills the trees had turned an evil-looking black and grew no leaves.<BR><BR>Johnstown of 1889 was not a pretty place. But the land around it was magnificent. From Main Street, a man standing among the holiday crowds could see green hills, small mountains, really, hunching in close on every side, dwarfing the tops of the houses and smokestacks.<BR><BR>The city was built on a nearly level flood plain at the confluence of two rivers, down at the bottom of an enormous hole in the Alleghenies. A visitor from the Middle West once commented, "Your sun rises at ten and sets at two," and it was not too great an exaggeration.<BR><BR>The rivers, except in spring, appeared to be of little consequence. The Little Conemaugh and Stony Creek, or the Stony Creek, as everyone in Johnstown has always said (since it is the Stony Creek River), are both more like rocky, oversized mountain streams than rivers. They are about sixty to eighty yards wide. Normally their current is very fast; in spring they run wild. But on toward August, as one writer of the 1880's said, there are places on either river where a good jumper could cross on dry stones.<BR><BR>The Little Conemaugh, which is much the swifter of the two, rushes in from the east, from the Allegheny Mountain. It begins near the very top of the mountain, about eighteen miles from Johnstown, at a coal town called Lilly. Its sources are Bear Rock Run and Bear Creek, Trout Run, Bens Creek, Laurel Run, South Fork Creek, Clapboard Run and Saltlick Creek. From an elevation of 2,300 feet at Lilly, the Little Conemaugh drops 1,147 feet to Johnstown.<BR><BR>The Stony Creek flows in from the south. It is a broader, deeper river than the other and is fed by streams with names like Beaver Dam Run, Fallen Timber Run, Shade Creek, and Paint Creek. Its total drainage is considerably more than that of the Little Conemaugh, and until 1889 it had always been thought to be the more dangerous of the two.<BR><BR>When they meet at Johnstown, the rivers form the Conemaugh, which, farther west, joins the Loyalhanna to form the Kiskiminetas, which in turn flows into the Allegheny about eighteen miles above Pittsburgh.<BR><BR>At Johnstown it was as though the bottom had dropped out of the old earth and left it angry and smoldering, while all around, the long, densely forested ridges, "hogbacks" they were called, rolled off in every direction like a turbulent green sea. The climb up out of the city took the breath fight out of you. But on top it was as though you had entered another world, clean, open, and sweetsmelling.<BR><BR>In 1889 there were still black bear and wildcats on Laurel Hill to the west of town. Though the loggers had long since stripped the near hills, there were still places within an hour's walk from Main Street where the forest was not much different than it had been a hundred years before.<BR><BR>Now and then an eagle could still be spotted high overhead. There were pheasants, ruffed grouse, geese, loons, and wild turkeys that weighed as much as twenty pounds. Plenty of men marching in the parade could remember the time before the war when there had been panthers in the mountains big enough to carry off a whole sheep. And it had been only a few years earlier when passenger pigeons came across the valley in numbers beyond belief. One January the Tribune wrote: "On Saturday there were immense flocks of wild pigeons flying over town, but yesterday it seemed as if all the birds of this kind at present in existence throughout the entire country were engaged in gyrating around overhead. One flock was declared to be at least three miles in length by half a mile wide."<BR><BR>Still, many days there were in the valley itself when the wind swept away the smoke and the acrid smell of the mills and the air was as good as a man could ask for. Many nights, and especially in winter, were the way mountain nights were meant to be, with millions of big stars hanging overhead in a sky the color of coal.<BR><BR>Looking back, most of the people who would remember Johnstown as it was on that Memorial Day claimed it was not as unpleasant a place as one might imagine. "People were poor, very poor by later standards," one man said, "but they didn't know it." And there was an energy, a vitality to life that they would miss in later years.<BR><BR>Many of the millworkers lived in cheap, pine-board company houses along the riverbanks, where, as the Tribune put it, "Loud and pestiferous stinks prevail." But there were no hideous slums, such as had spread across the Lower East Side of New York or in Chicago and Pittsburgh. The kind of appalling conditions that would be described the next year by Jacob Riis in his How the Other Half Lives did not exist then in Johnstown. No one went hungry, or begging, though there were always tramps about, drifters, who came with the railroad, heading west nearly always, knocking at back doors for something to eat.<BR><BR>They were part of the landscape and people took them for granted, except when they started coming through in big numbers and there were alarming stories in the papers about crowds of them hanging around the depot.<BR><BR>One diary, kept by a man who lived outside of town, includes a day-by-day tramp count. "Wednesday, May 1, 1889, Two Tramps...Thursday, May 2, Two Tramps," and so on, with nearly a tramp or two every day, week after week.<BR><BR>New people came to town, found a job or, if not, moved on again, toward Pittsburgh. But for most everyone who decided to stay there was work. Although lately, Johnstown men, too, had been picking up and going west to try their luck at the mills in St. Louis or the mines in Colorado. And lately the jobs they left behind were being filled by "hunkies" brought in to "work cheap."<BR><BR>The idea did not please people much. Nor did it matter whether the contract workers were Italians, Poles, Hungarians, Russians, or Swedes; they were all called Hungarians, "bohunks" or "hunkies." But so far, and again unlike the big cities, Johnstown had only a few such men, and most of them lived in Cambria City, just down the fiver, beyond the new stone bridge that carried the main line of the Pennsylvania across the Conemaugh.<BR><BR>The vast majority of the people who lined Main Street watching the parade were either Irish, Scotch-Irish, or Cornish (Cousin Jacks, they were called), German or Welsh, with the Germans and the Welsh greatly outnumbering all the rest. There were some Negroes, but not many, and a few of the leading merchants were Jews.<BR><BR>The Germans and the Welsh had been the first settlers. More of them, plus the Scotch-Irish, had come along soon after to work in the mines and first forges. Quite a few of the big Irishmen in the crowd had come in originally to build the railroad, then stayed on. Johnstown had been an active stop along the Underground Railroad, and a few of the Negroes had come in that way. Others of them came later to work in the tannery.<BR><BR>There were German and Welsh churches in town, a German newspaper, and several Irish fortunetellers. Welsh and German were spoken everywhere, along with enough other brogues, burrs, and twangs to make a "plain American" feel he was in a country of "feriners," or so it often seemed.<BR><BR>The first white settlers in the valley had been Solomon and Samuel Adams and their sister Rachael, who came over the Allegheny Mountains from Bedford about 1771 and cleared a patch of land near the Stony Creek. Until then the place had been known as Conemack Old Town, after a Delaware Indian village that stood about where the Memorial Day parade had gathered that noon at the foot of Main.<BR><BR>Samuel Adams and an Indian killed each other in a knife fight, and the traditional story is that Rachael was also killed by Indians soon after. Solomon made a fast retreat back to the stockade at Bedford, and it was not for another twenty years or thereabouts that the first permanent settler arrived. In 1794, about the time President Washington was sending an army over the mountains to put down the so-called Whiskey Rebellion in Pittsburgh, Joseph Schantz, or Johns, an Amish farmer from Switzerland, came into the valley with his wife and four children. He cleared off thirty acres between the rivers, raised a cabin, planted an orchard, and laid out a village which he called Conemaugh Old Town -- or just Conemaugh -- and which he had every hope for becoming the county seat.<BR><BR>When the county was established in 1804 and given the old Latin name for Wales -- Cambria Ebensburg, a mountain village fifteen miles to the north, was picked as county seat. Three years later Joseph Johns sold his village and moved on.<BR><BR>The next proprietor was a long-haired "York County Dutchman" (a Pennsylvania German) named Peter Levergood, and from then until the canal came through, the town remained no more than a backwoods trading center. But with the arrival of the canal it became the busiest place in the county. By 1835 Johnstown, as it was by then known, had a drugstore, a newspaper, a Presbyterian church, and a distillery. By 1840 its population, if the nearby settlements were counted, had probably passed 3,000. Then, in the 1850's, the Pennsylvania Railroad came through, the Cambria Iron Company was established, and everything changed.<BR><BR>By the start of the 1880's Johnstown and its neighboring boroughs had a total population of about 15,000. Within the next nine years the population doubled. On the afternoon of May 30, 1889, there were nearly 30,000 people living in the valley.<BR><BR>Properly speaking Johnstown was only one of several boroughs -- East Conemaugh, Woodvale, Conemaugh, Cambria City, Prospect, Millville, Morrellville, Grubbtown, Moxham, Johnstown -- which were clustered between the hills, packed in so tight that there was scarcely room to build anything more.<BR><BR>Petty political jealousies and differences over taxes had kept them from uniting. As it was there was no telling where one began or the other ended unless you knew, which, of course, everyone who lived there did. Millville, Prospect, and Cambria City, it was said, lived on the pay roll of the Cambria mills; Conemaugh lived on the Gautier wire works, Woodvale on the woolen mills there, and Johnstown, in turn, lived on all the rest of them. Johnstown was the center of the lot, geographically and in every other way. It was far and away the largest, with a population of its own of perhaps 10,000 by 1889, which was four times greater than even the biggest of the others. The banks were there, the hotels, the jail, and a fulltime police force of nine.<BR><BR>There were five-story office buildings on Main and up-to-date stores. The town had an opera house, a night school, a library, a remarkable number of churches, and several large, handsome houses, most of which were owned by men high up in the Iron Company.<BR><BR>Much would be written later on how the wealthy men of Johnstown lived on the high ground, while the poor were crowded into the lowlands. The fact was that the most imposing houses in town were all on Main Street, and one of the largest clusters of company houses was up on Prospect Hill.<BR><BR>The rest of the people lived in two- and three-story frame houses which, often as not, had a small porch in front and a yard with shade trees and a few outbuildings in back. Nearly everyone had a picket fence around his property, and in spite of its frenzied growth, the city still had more than a few signs of its recent village past.<BR><BR>On the 22nd of May, for example, the town fathers had gathered at the City Council chambers to settle various matters of the moment, the most pressing of which was to amend Section 12 of Chapter XVI of the Codified Ordinance of the Borough of Johnstown. The word "cow" was to be inserted after "goat" in the third line, so that it would from then on read: "Section 12. Any person who shall willfully suffer his horse, mare, gelding, mule, hog, goat, cow, or geese to run at large within the Borough shall for each offense forfeit and pay for each of said animals so running at large the sum of one dollar..."<BR><BR>Life was comparatively simple, pleasures few. There were Saturday night band concerts in the park, and lectures at the library. Sundays half the town put on its best and went walking. Families would pick one of the neighboring boroughs and walk out and back, seeing much and, naturally, being seen all along the way.<BR><BR>There was a new show at the Washington Street Opera House every other night or so. Thus far in 1889 it had been an especially good season, with such favorites as Zozo the Magic Queen (which brought its "splendid production" in "OUR OWN SPECIAL SCENERY CAR") and Uncle Tom's Cabin appearing in a single week. (Harriet Beecher Stowe's little drama had also changed considerably since the years before the war. The Johnstown performance, for example, featured "a pack of genuine bloodhounds; two Topsies; Two Marks, Eva and her Pony 'Prince'; African Mandolin Players; 'Tinker' the famous Trick Donkey.")<BR><BR>There was also the Unique Rink for roller skating, a fad which seemed to be tapering off some that spring. There was superb fishing along the Conemaugh and the Stony Creek in spring and summer. Downstream from town the river was stained by waste dumped from the mills, but above town the water still ran clear between sun-bleached boulders and was full of catfish, sunfish, mullet, walleyed pike that everyone mistakenly called salmon, trout, eels, and speedy, mud-colored crawfish.<BR><BR>In spring, too, there was nearly always a good brawl when the circus came to town. In the fall, when the sour gums turned bloodred against the pines, there was wonderful hunting on the mountains, and fresh deer hanging from butcher shop meathooks was one of the signs of the season. In winter there were sleigh rides to Ebensburg, tobogganing parties, and ice skating at the Von Lunen pond across from the new Johnson Street Rail works up the Stony Creek at Moxham.<BR><BR>And year round there was a grand total of 123 saloons to choose from in the greater Johnstown area, ranging from California Tom's on Market Street to the foul-smelling holes along the back alleys of Cambria City. California Tom Davis had been a forty-niner. He was one of the colorful characters of Johnstown and the back room of his saloon was the favorite gathering place for those professional men and Cambria Iron officials who liked to take a sociable drink now and then.<BR><BR>But the average saloon was simply a place where a workingman could stop off at the end of the day to settle the fierce thirst the heat of the furnaces left him with, or to clear the coal dust from his throat. He was always welcome there, without a shave or a change of clothes. It was his club. He had a schooner of beer or a shot; most of the time he spent talking.<BR><BR>Like any steel town Johnstown had a better than average number of hard-line drinking men. On payday Saturdays the bartenders were the busiest people in town. And week after week Monday's paper carried an item or two about a "disturbance" Saturday night on Washington Street or in Cambria City, and published the names of two or three citizens who had spent the night in the lockup for behaving in "frontier fashion."<BR><BR>For those of still earthier appetite there was Lizzie Thompson's place on Frankstown Hill, at the end of Locust Street. It was the best-known of the sporting houses, but there were others too, close by, and on Prospect Hill. And one spring a similar enterprise had flourished for weeks in the woods outside of town, when several itinerant "soiled doves," as the Tribune called them, set up business in an abandoned coal mine.<BR><BR>But primarily, life in Johnstown meant a great deal of hard work for just about everybody. Not only because that was how life was then, but because people had the feeling they were getting somewhere. The country seemed hell-bent for a glorious new age, and Johnstown, clearly, was right up there booming along with the best of them. Pittsburgh and Chicago were a whole lot bigger, to be sure, and taking a far bigger part of the business. But that was all right. For Johnstown these were the best years ever.<BR><BR>Progress was being made, and it was not just something people were reading about. It was happening all around them, touching their lives.<BR><BR>Streets were bright at night now with sputtering white are lights. There was a new railroad station with bright-colored awnings. The hospital was new; two new business blocks had been finished on Main. A telephone exchange had begun service that very year, in January, and already there were more than seventy phones in town. Quite a few houses had new bathrooms. The Hulbert House, the new hotel on Clinton Street, had an elevator and steam heat.<BR><BR>There was a street railway out to Woodvale and another up to Moxham. Almost everyone had electricity or natural gas in his home. There were typewriters in most offices, and several people had already bought one of the new Kodak "detective" cameras. "Anybody can use the Kodak," the advertisements said.<BR><BR>Inventions and changes were coming along so fast that it was hard to keep up with them all. The town had no debts, taxes were low, and the cost of things was coming down little by little.<BR><BR>Of course, there were some who looked askance at so much change and liked to talk about the old days when they said there had never been so much drinking, no prostitution, and men could still do a day's work without complaining. There was also strong resentment against the company, and quiet talk of trouble to come, though it would have been very hard for most men among those Memorial Day crowds to have imagined there ever being an actual strike in the mills. The miners had tried it, twice, and both times the company had clamped down with such speed and decisiveness that the strikes had been broken in no time.<BR><BR>And there were floods and fires and, worst of all, epidemics that hit so swiftly and unexpectedly, terrifying everyone, and killing so many children. The last bad time had been in 1879, when diphtheria killed 132 children within a few months. Death was always near, and there was never any telling when k would strike again.<BR><BR>Year in, year out men were killed in the mills, or maimed for life. Small boys playing around the railroad tracks that cut in and out of the town would jump too late or too soon and lose a leg or an arm, or lie in a coma for weeks with the whole town talking about them until they stopped breathing forever.<BR><BR>But had not life always been so? Was not hard work the will of the Lord? ("In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground...") And yes, death too? ("...for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return")<BR><BR>And besides, was k not a fine thing to be where there was so much going on, so much to keep a man busy and his family eating regularly?<BR><BR>So far it had been a good year. Except for measles the town seemed pretty heathy. Talk was that it would be a good summer for steel. Prices might well improve, and perhaps wages with them, and there would be no labor trouble to complicate things, as there would probably be in Pittsburgh.<BR><BR>The Quicksteps, Johnstown's beloved baseball team, had made a rather poor showing so far, losing to Braddock, Greensburg, and McKeesport in a row; but they had beaten Altoona once, and most people felt that about made up for it. The newspapers were full of stories about the World's Fair opening in Paris, and its Eiffel Tower, and about the Oklahoma Territory opening up out west. Towers of structural steel could reach nearly to the heavens, and Americans could turn a dusty prairie into farms and whole new cities overnight. It was some time to be alive.<BR><BR>But perhaps best of all there seemed such a strong spirit of national unity everywhere. The Constitutional government those Grand Army veterans had fought for had just celebrated its one hundredth birthday that spring and there had been quite a to-do about it in the newspapers and picture magazines. "A nation in its high hour of imperial power and prosperity looks back a hundred years to its obscure and doubtful beginning..." one article began. That the next one hundred years would be better still, bringing wondrous advantages and rewards to millions of people who had also come from "obscure and doubtful" beginnings, seemed about as certain as anything could be; and especially in a place like Johnstown, on a day when flags were flying from one end of town to the other, and the "Boys in Blue" were marching again.<BR><BR>When the rain started coming down about four o'clock, it was very fine and gentle, little more than a cold mist. Even so, no one welcomed it. There had already been more than a hundred days of rain that year, and the rivers were running high as it was. The first signs of trouble had been a heavy snow in April, which had melted almost as soon as it came down. Then in May there had been eleven days of rain.<BR><BR>The rivers ran high every spring. That was to be expected. Some springs they ran so high they filled the lower half of town to the top doorstep. A few times the water had been level with first-floor windows along several streets. Floods had become part of the season, like the dogwood blooming on the mountain. Yet, each year, there was the hope that perhaps this time the rivers might behave themselves.<BR><BR>It had already been such a curious year for weather. A tornado in February had killed seventeen people in Pittsburgh. Not much had happened in Johnstown, but the wind carried off a tin church roof at Loretto. The April snow had been the heaviest of the whole year, with fourteen inches or more in the mountains. And all through May, temperatures had been bouncing every which way, up in the eighties one day, down below freezing two nights later, then back to the eighties again. Now it felt more like March than May.<BR><BR>About five the rain stopped and left everything freshly rinsed looking. The Reverend Chapman, back on his front porch after participating at the graveside ceremonies, sat gazing at the park with its big elms and draped chain fence, and thought to himself that he had seldom looked upon a lovelier scene. Or at least so he wrote later on.<BR><BR>The Reverend had been in Johnstown only a few years, and k had been just the month before that he and his wife, Agnes, had moved into the new parsonage. He had grown up along the canal to the west of Johnstown, at Blairsville, where his father had eked out a living painting decorative scenes and designs on packet boats. His first church had been in Ligonier, on the other side of Laurel Hill. Later there had been churches in New Florence and Bolivar, down the Conemaugh, and half a dozen other places between Johnstown and Pittsburgh. He liked every one of them, he said, but Johnstown was something special. His stone church next door was the largest in town, a landmark, and except for St. Joseph's, the German Catholic church over in Conemaugh borough, no church had a larger membership. His neighbors across the park, Dr. Lowman and John Fulton, were the finest sort of Christian gentlemen, and their homes were as elegantly furnished as any in town. The Dibert bank, Griffith's drugstore, the post office and the Tribune offices on the floor above it, were all but a few steps from the Reverend's front door. The parsonage faced on to Franklin Street, at almost the exact dead center of Johnstown.<BR><BR>Night settled in and the lights came on along Franklin and Main. A few blocks away William Kuhn and Daisy Homer were being married in a small ceremony at the bride's home. At the Opera House Mr. Augustin Daly's New York production of A Night Off, "The comedy success of two continents," was playing to a small house. Daly was the foremost theatrical producer of the day, and A Night Off had been his biggest hit for several years. Like some of his other productions, it was an adaptation from a German comedy, a fact which the Johnstown audience undoubtedly appreciated.<BR><BR>Other than that not much else was going on. Because of the holiday there had been no paper that morning, but according to Wednesday's Tribune, rainstorms were expected late that Thursday; tomorrow, Friday, was to be slightly warmer. The barometric pressure was reported at thirty, temperature from forty-six to sixty-five, humidity at sixty-nine per cent.<BR><BR>About nine the rain began again, gentle and quiet as earlier. But an hour or so later it started pouring and there seemed no end to it. "Sometime in the night," according to Chapman, "my wife asked if it were not raining very hard, and I being very sleepy, barely conscious of the extraordinary downpour simply answered, 'Yes,' and went to sleep, thinking no more of it until morning."<BR><BR>George Heiser's day did not end until after ten. It was his practice to keep the store open until then. With the saloons along Washington Street doing business on into the night, there were generally people about and he could pick up a little more trade. Either he or his wife Mathilde would be looking after things behind the counter, in among the queen's ware and the barrels of sugar and crackers, the cases of Ewarts tobacco and yellow laundry soap, needles, spools, pins, and Clark's "O-N-T" (Our New Thread).<BR><BR>George and Mathilde Heiser, and their sixteen-year-old son, Victor, lived upstairs over the store. They had been at the same location, 224 Washington, for several years now and, at long last, business was looking up. At fifty-two, for the first time in his life, George Heiser was getting on in the world.<BR><BR>Washington Street ran parallel to Main, two blocks to the north. From the Stony Creek over to the Little Conemaugh, the east-west streets -- the "up" streets they were called -- ran Vine, Lincoln, Main, Locust, Washington. Then came the B & O tracks and the B & O depot which was directly across the street from the Heiser store. Beyond the tracks were two more streets, Broad and Pearl, then the Little Conemaugh, and on the other side of that rose Prospect Hill, steep as a roof. With the town growing the way it had been, the Baltimore & Ohio had brought in a spur from Somerset eight years before to try to take away some of the freight business from the Pennsylvania. An old schoolhouse had been converted into a depot, and the steady night and day racket of the trains right by their window had made quite a difference to the Heisers. But with the store doing as well as it was, George Heiser had few complaints.<BR><BR>George had been troubled by bad luck much of his life. During the war, at Fredericksburg, when his unit had been making a rapid withdrawal, his companion in the ranks, a fellow named Pike, got hit and went down grabbing on to George's leg and pleading for George not to leave him. As a result they were both captured and George spent the rest of the war in Libby Prison. Then, years later, at a time when he seemed to be getting nowhere in Johnstown, George had gone off north to Oil City hoping to strike it rich. He wound up running a butcher shop instead and in no time was back in Johnstown, flat broke, wiped out by fire and his own lack of business sense.<BR><BR>George had not marched in the parade that afternoon. His blue uniform seldom ever came out of the big wardrobe upstairs. He was not much for parades and the like. He seldom mixed in politics, never became an enthusiastic church man. He neither smoked nor chewed, though he would take a beer every so often and once a year he liked to make wine down in the cellar. He did enjoy the Grand Army meetings, but that was largely because he enjoyed being with his friends. People liked him. He was a good storyteller, easygoing. He was also about as physically powerful as any man in town, and he was a very soft touch. He could lift a barrel full of sugar, which was considered quite a feat; but naming away a friend whose credit might not be the best seemed more than he was up to.<BR><BR>Twice in his life he had let friends have money when they came to him; twice he had suffered heavily from the loss. Fortunately for the Heisers, Mathilde was a determined and sensible wife. She was the manager of the two, and after George came back from Oil City she took charge. She kept the books, saw that he did not let much go on credit. Nor would she allow him to set any chairs out on the bare wooden floor. Otherwise, she said, his cronies would be sitting about half the day giving the place the wrong sort of appearance. They had at last been able to add a new window to the store front and appearances would be maintained so long as Mathilde had her say.<BR><BR>Mathilde's appearance was straightforward and intelligent. She had a fine head of dark-brown hair, a high forehead, and a set to her mouth that suggested she knew where she was going and that chances were good she would get there. She had had a considerable amount of education for a woman of that time and continued to keep up with her reading. Education was the thing, a proper education and hard work. It had been her way of life since childhood in Germany, and she intended to pass it on to the pride of her life, her son.<BR><BR>Victor was her second child. The first, a girl, had died of diphtheria. Victor had been struck down with it too, but he had been stronger. He looked much like his father now, only a ganglier, rawboned version. He was a serious, pink-faced boy, with big feet and blond hair, taller already than most men and far better educated. At sixteen he knew several languages, was well along in advanced mathematics, and had read about as widely as any boy in Johnstown. At his mother's insistence, his life was a steady round of school, homework, and being tutored in one extra course or another. If George Heiser had had his troubles making his way, that was one thing; Victor, Mathilde Heiser was determined, would not just get on, he would excel. There would be no going off to the Cambria works or coal mines for this young man, and no clerking behind a store counter either.<BR><BR>Now and again Victor had his moments away from all that. His father would step in and see that he got some time off. George Heiser had a wonderful way with children. He was forever telling them stories and listening to theirs. He took a great interest in his son and his schemes, one of which was to build a raft and float down the Conemaugh to the Allegheny, then on to the Ohio and Mississippi. Victor had taken some night classes in mechanical drawing at the library and had worked up plans on how the raft should be built. His idea was to catch the Conemaugh when it was high, otherwise he knew he would run aground.<BR><BR>In summer he would bring home accounts of his long rides out of town to the open country above the valley. Once he and one of his friends had gone all the way to the South Fork dam to take a look at the lake and the summer colony, but they had been sent on their way by the grounds keeper and never got to see much.<BR><BR>Other nights Victor talked about walking to the edge of town to watch the big summer revival meeting. He loved the powerful singing and the whooping and hollering of people "getting religion." On the way home he and his friends would try to imitate what they had seen, laughing and pounding each other on the back as they came along the streets. This was the kind of education George Heiser understood. He had grown up in Johnstown himself. His people had been among the Pennsylvania Germans who first settled the valley.<BR><BR>After ten the Heiser store was closed for the day, the lights out downstairs. When the downpour began, George and Mathilde did not think much of it, except that there would almost certainly be high water in the morning. But the thought bothered them very little, except for the inconveniences there might be. They listened to the rain drum on the roof and were glad to be inside.<BR><BR>If there was such a thing as a typical married couple in Johnstown on the night of May 30, 1889, George and Mathilde Heiser would come about as close as any to qualifying. Together, like Johnstown itself, they combined an Old World will to make good in the New with a sort of earlier-American, cracker-barrel willingness to take life pretty much as it came. Unlike a large number of Johnstown people, they were not directly beholden to the Cambria Iron Company, but their fortunes, like those of the entire valley, depended nonetheless on how red those skies glowed at night.<BR><BR>They had suffered the death of a child; they had tried their luck elsewhere and had lost. They fought dirt daily, saved every spare nickel, and took tremendous pride in the progress they were making. All things considered, Johnstown seemed a good place to be. It was their home.<BR><BR>Copyright ® 1968 by David McCullough

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Your business success is now forever linked to the success of your customers Customer Success is the groundbreaking guide to the exciting new model of customer management. Business relationships are fundamentally changing. In the world B.C. (Before Cloud), companies could focus totally on sales and marketing because customers were often 'stuck' after purchasing. Therefore, all of the 'post-sale' experience was a cost center in most companies. In the world A.B.

#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<BR><BR>Nola Brown, the U.S. Army's artist-in-residence-a painter and trained soldier-sees something nobody was supposed to see and earns a dangerous enemy in this novel as powerful as "a launched torpedo slashing through 400 pages of deep water before reaching impact...one of the best thrill rides ever" (David Baldacci).<BR><BR>Who is Nola Brown?<BR><BR>Nola is a mystery<BR><BR>Nola is trouble.<BR><BR>And Nola is supposed to be dead.<BR><BR>Her body was found on a plane that mysteriously fell from the sky as it left a secret military base in the Alaskan wilderness. Her commanding officer verifies she's dead. The US government confirms it. But Jim "Zig" Zigarowski has just found out the truth: Nola is still alive. And on the run.<BR><BR>Zig works at Dover Air Force Base, helping put to rest the bodies of those who die on top-secret missions. Nola was a childhood friend of Zig's daughter and someone who once saved his daughter's life. So when Zig realizes Nola is still alive, he's determined to find her. Yet as Zig digs into Nola's past, he learns that trouble follows Nola everywhere she goes.<BR><BR>Together, Nola and Zig will either reveal a sleight of hand being played at the highest levels of power or die trying to uncover the US Army's most mysterious secret-a centuries-old conspiracy that traces back through history to the greatest escape artist of all: Harry Houdini.<BR><BR>"Meltzer is a master and this is his best. Not since The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo have you seen a character like this. Get ready to meet Nola. If you've never tried Meltzer, this is the one."- Harlan Coben<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>*01/15/2018<BR>Mortician Jim "Zig" Zigarowski, the hero of this stellar series launch from bestseller Meltzer (The Book of Lies), works the U.S. government's most top-secret and high-profile cases at Dover Air Force base in present-day Delaware. Zig's world changes when a military plane mysteriously crashes in the Alaskan wilderness and the body of soldier Nola Brown, who as a child saved his daughter from an explosion at a Girl Scout camp years before, arrives on his table. As Zig prepares the body, he discovers that the scars Nola sustained at camp are missing, and he becomes suspicious. When he finds a crumpled piece of paper in the woman's stomach, a warning for Nola, his suspicions are confirmed: this isn't Nola. Zig is determined to discover what happened to her and whether she's safe. The closer he gets to the truth, the more dangerous it becomes. Soon he finds himself in the middle of Operation Bluebook, a secret government program that goes back to Harry Houdini. With its remarkable plot and complex characters, this page-turner not only entertains but also provides a fascinating glimpse into American history. Author tour.

In Nola and Zig, too, he's created two of his most compellingly fresh characters. Nola, in particular, represents a high point in the author's career: a strong, resourceful, mysterious female lead who could go toe-to-toe with Jack Reacher, Bob Lee Swagger, and the other guys. First of a new series, according to the publisher, and that's just fine."-Booklist - From the Publisher<BR><BR>*02/01/2018<BR>Jim "Zig" Zigarowski is a mortician at Dover Air Force Base, where he prepares the returning bodies of U.S. heroes so they can have proper burial, and thus providing closure for the families. Years earlier, a girl named Nola Brown saved his daughter from severe injury, and now her corpse arrives at Dover after a suspicious plane crash in Alaska that also killed other government operatives. Feeling grateful to Nola, Zig intercepts her body to prepare it himself. He quickly realizes the dead woman is not Nola and wonders about her true identity. This discovery sets Zig on a harrowing path of danger, subterfuge, and government secrets as he searches for Nola and tries to discover the secret that has made her a danger to the government she serves as the U.S. Army's artist-in-residence. VERDICT Weaving the past with the present and creating a conspiracy with connections to magician Harry Houdini, Meltzer's series launch is a gripping thriller that will not disappoint his many fans. A true page-turner. [See Prepub Alert, 9/25/17]--Sandra Knowles, South Carolina State Lib., Columbia - Library Journal<BR><BR>2017-12-07<BR>An Army mortician teams up, sort of, with a military artist who just won't die to thwart an obscenely shape-shifting conspiracy.Everybody has some God-given talent. Jim Zigarowski's is to make the dead look presentable for the families who come to view their remains at the Dover Air Force Base. When the bombing of a military plane from Alaska kills all seven aboard, Zig's attention is drawn not to the headline victim--Librarian of Congress Nelson Rookstool, an old friend of President Orson Wallace--but to Sgt. Nola Brown, an Army artist-in-residence who years ago saved the life of 12-year-old Maggie Zigarowski, though she couldn't prevent Zig's daughter from dying scarcely a year later. Illegally grabbing the job of preparing Nola's remains from the mortician assigned to the case, Zig quickly discovers that the remains aren't Nola's after all. His joy that Nola is still alive is tempered by the sobering realization that an awful lot of people have conspired to cover up this happy news by signing off on her death. Inevitably, the living Nola returns, determined to get to the bottom of the bombing. By that time, veteran suspenser Meltzer (co-author: The House of Secrets, 2016, etc.) has begun a series of harrowing flashbacks to Nola's childhood and adolescence that firmly establish her as the most damaged heroine in the genre since Lisbeth Salander. Uncovering traces of a sinister scheme called Operation Bluebook, Zig and Nola work--often at cross-purposes, though not when they need to save each other's lives--through a web of corrupt procurers, creatively armed killers, and board-certified magicians to trace and neutralize Bluebook before its resourceful conspirators can kill Zig and finish the job they bungled on Nola.The same mixture as before: a sweeping, overplotted, overscaled account of high crimes, misdemeanors, and violent coverups and reprisals. But those flashbacks into the heroine's traumatic early years, although they seriously disrupt the momentum of the blood-and-thunder present-day plot, sting long after the details of that plot have faded. - Kirkus Reviews

Aficionados of the hit TV show The West Wing who are sufferingthrough holiday reruns will jump right into Brad Meltzer's third novel (afterThe Tenth Justice and Dead Even), which takes readers into theWhite House office of the president's own law firm and introduces a firstdaughter whose complex psychological problems jump-start this fast-pacedthriller. Michael Garrick loves his job as deputy counsel, but when he falls forNora Hartson, the president's daughter, the conflict between his professionalethics and his growing love for her puts him right in the middle of a murderplot that may reach all the way to the Oval Office. Meltzer excels at plotting, and he knows the back corridors, family quarters,and secret tunnels of the executive branch as well as those of the SupremeCourt, which he revealed in his first two blockbusters. He's not as skillful atcharacterization. It's hard to believe that the sociopathic tendencies of peoplein a president's inner circle--or even his family--would have managed to escapethe scrutiny of an FBI investigation during his rise to power. And Nora, inparticular, doesn't quite come off as the misguided victim she must be in orderto make the rest of the story credible. But that's not a huge quibble; Meltzermanages to make Edgar Simon, Michael's boss, the most interesting White Housecounsel since John Dean. The First Counsel is a cleverly commercial mixof legal thriller and political chicanery guaranteed to keep you turning pagesuntil Meltzer puts the third branch of government in his sights, too. --JaneAdams

Winner of the 2015 National Jewish Book Award in Education and Jewish Identity from the Jewish Book Council <BR><BR>The history of an iconic food in Jewish American culture<BR><BR>For much of the twentieth century, the New York Jewish deli was an iconic institution in both Jewish and American life. As a social space it rivaledâand in some ways surpassedâthe synagogue as the primary gathering place for the Jewish community. In popular culture it has been the setting for classics like When Harry Met Sally. And today, after a long period languishing in the trenches of the hopelessly old-fashioned, it is experiencing a nostalgic resurgence. <BR><BR>Pastrami on Rye is the first full-length history of the New York Jewish deli. The deli, argues Ted Merwin, reached its full flowering not in the immigrant period, as some might assume, but in the interwar era, when the children of Jewish immigrants celebrated the first flush of their success in America by downing sandwiches and cheesecake in theater district delis. But it was the kosher deli that followed Jews as they settled in the outer boroughs of the city, and that became the most tangible symbol of their continuing desire to maintain a connection to their heritage. Ultimately, upwardly mobile American Jews discarded the deli as they transitioned from outsider to insider status in the middle of the century. Now contemporary Jews are returning the deli to cult status as they seek to reclaim their cultural identities. <BR><BR>Richly researched and compellingly told, Pastrami on Rye gives us the surprising story of a quintessential New York institution.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Ted Merwin... delivers a scholarly paean--like an ample but lean corned beef sandwich--to a vanishing New York ethnic icon." â New York Times "Metropolitan"<BR><BR>"Try reading Ted Merwins new book,Pastrami on Ryewithout having your mouth water.Merwin offers plenty of delicious descriptions as he traces how delis rose up first as take-out services for Jewish immigrants, to gathering places for Jewish communities, to symbols of integration as pastrami piled high became popular nationwide." â New York Post<BR><BR>"The writing is so lively and entertaining readers will forget theyre being educated. The work is also an excellent example of a multidisciplinary approach combining food studies, Judaic studies, history and sociology." â Long Island Jewish World<BR><BR>"A pleasing exercise in culinary and cultural history, evoking some favorite New York-centric comfort foods... [Merwin] does a solid job of locating the delicatessen... as a cultural and culinary center of New York Jewish life." â Kirkus Reviews<BR><BR>"[V]ery well researched and enjoyable." â JWeekly.com<BR><BR>"Merwins tasty exploration of deli cuisine and culture also tracks larger shifts in the American Jewish experience, particularly in the post-World War II period when delis upstaged shuls as Jewish gathering places." â JTA<BR><BR>"Merwin has written a spectacularly funny, engaging and sharply analytical book." â Forward<BR><BR>"[A]cultural history of American Judaism told through a particularly revealing culinary lens." â Haaretz<BR><BR>"Avital addition to the academic literature in cultural history, American studies, American Jewish studies, food studies, and popular culture studies." â Journal of American Culture<BR><BR>"Thorough and thoughtful, scholarly and readable, Ted Merwin's Pastrami on Rye provides a vital addition to the academic literature in cultural history, American studies, American Jewish studies, food studies, and popular culture studies." â Journal of American Culture<BR><BR>"Pastrami on Rye proves entertaining, provocative, and--appropriately--food for thought." â JewishBookCouncil.org<BR><BR>"Combining a flair for anecdote with exhaustive research, Merwin has produced an exuberantly readable history of delis, and he reveals how their prepared foods helped free early twentieth-century women from daily kitchen drudgery. The very success of ethnic Jewish delicatessens led inevitably to cultural assimilation for Jews and to appreciative acceptance by Gentiles, and the delicatessen became indisputably an American institution." â Booklist<BR><BR>"In Pastrami on Rye, author Ted Merwin captures the essence of the New York deli experience...Merwin offers a thoughtful, 'overstuffed' look at all aspects of the Jewish deli by examining the role of its food in America through, as he puts it, the 'greasy...gluttonous lens of the pastrami sandwich.' [A] delightful exploration of one of America's favorite culinary institutions." â Chicago Tribune<BR><BR>"[Merwin's] writing is so lively and entertaining readers will forget they're being educated. The workis also an excellent example of a multidisciplinary approach--combining food studies, Judaic studies, history and sociology." â Reporter<BR><BR>"[Pastrami on Rye] is an entertaining work of merit, written in a fluent style that recalls Calvin Trillin at his foodie best and Ludwig Bemelmans at his most observant." â Santa Fe New Mexican<BR><BR>"Professor and journalist Ted Merwin uses interviews, archives and popular representation to tell the history of the Jewish deli in America. Calling on food studies and an eclectic mix of sociological theory, he builds a narrative from a space of civic engagement and mutual support, it grows into a site bound up with nostalgic and un-nuanced readings of the past." â Religion & Culture<BR><BR>"The fruit of more than ten years of research and writing, Mr. Merwin's account shows that delis have been a rich part of the story of Jewish assimilation in America." â The Economist<BR><BR>"Merwin has set out to trace the rise and fall of the delicatessen in American Jewish culture, using this analysis to help us understand the American-immigrant experience. He has been more than successful. By meticulous and thorough research, Merwin has shown that in the postwar migration to the suburbs, city neighborhoods fragmented and delis closed." â St. Louis Jewish Light<BR><BR>"Pastrami on Rye is both a celebration of the deli and an elegy for it. This lively book traces the delis evolution from dynamic gathering place to kitschy tourist site, peppered with hefty doses of popular culture. Merwin tells a fascinating story of cultural and culinary assimilation as he explores what it means to be modern and American. This book left me longing for the lost delis of my youth!" -- Darra Goldstein,Founding Editor, Gastronomica: The Journal of Food and Culture<BR><BR>"Brings together a vast range of scholarship and anecdote to produce the first comprehensive history of the Jewish delicatessen. Both culinary and cultural history, this book will be of interest to scholars and common readers alike, the former for its incisive interpretations of modern Jewish foodways and the latter for its ability to recreate a time and place that was 'home' for so many 20th century Jews in America. Its evocation of deli menus alone will get your mouth watering." -- David Kraemer,author of Jewish Eating and Jewish Identity Through the Ages<BR><BR>"In Pastrami on Rye, Merwin finally addresses the pressing question overlooked in his first book on New York Jews (In Their Own Image): but where did they eat? This fun and informative examination of the New York Jewish deli is half history and half love story; batampte und geshmacht, with a heaping helping of sakhelyoull kvell before you plotz!" -- Eric Michael Mazur,co-editor of God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture<BR><BR>"Merwins extraordinarily exhaustive research and his skill in selecting just the right fact, telling detail, quote, and anecdote makes this one of the most enjoyable, enlightening, fluid and fascinating food histories I've ever read. And it is my history, too, being one of those many Jews for whom the delicatessen and love of delicatessen foods is as much a part of my identity as the ethics and humanity my religion has taught me." -- Arthur Schwartz,author of Arthur Schwartz's Jewish Home Cooking: Yiddish Recipes Revisited<BR><BR>"A comprehensive history of the New York deli from its European antecedent beginnings to what Ted Merwin calls the 'postgastronomic' deli we have today. After doing exhaustive research into the subject, Dr. Merwin has put his scholarly pen and thoughtful gaze to work to create this marvelous book. I got really hungry for pastrami reading this comprehensive story of the American deli. Now that is a sign of a great read." -- Joan Nathan,author of Quiches, Kugels and Couscous: My Search for Jewish Cooking in France<BR><BR>"Merwin's long awaited history of the deli delivers like the best deli fress: this is a book that nails the mustard-slicked soulful flavor of this cultural gem, with a heft of academic substance that leaves the mind thoroughly satisfied (and the body starved for chopped liver)." -- David Sax,author of The Tastemakers: Why We're Crazy for Cupcakes but Fed Up with Fondue<BR><BR>"In Pastrami on Rye, Ted Merwin gamely sets out to show how American Jews evolved from the clannish immigrants of the late 1800s into well-heeled secularists who atone for their parents' assimilation through (mostly culinary) nostalgia." â The Times Literary Supplement,Samuel Ashworth<BR><BR>"This delightful book just about guarantees that its readers will want to head to the nearest deli for a hot pastrami sandwich, or maybe corned beef, naturally on fresh rye bread." â Western States Jewish History<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Ted Merwin is Associate Professor of Religion and Judaic Studies at Dickinson College (PA), where he is Founding Director of the Milton B.

An Apollo astronaut details his quest to reconcile the seemingly disparate worlds of science and faith, combining elements of history, science, and theology to explain the mysteries of human consciousness, the universal connectedness of life, miracles, and human destiny.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Among authors trying to bridge the gap between science and spirit, former astronaut Mitchell brings unique credentials. Originally scheduled for the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission, Mitchell, as told in this smooth blend of autobiography and exegesis, journeyed to the Moon in 1971 (and generated great controversy over ESP experiments he conducted on the flight). As he gazed on Earth, surrounded by blackness and an unfathomable number of stars, he experienced "an overwhelming sense of universal connectedness" that was to change his life. Within a few years, he had left NASA and founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences, aimed at the systematic study of the nature of consciousness. At the institute, he came to some fascinating conclusions, detailed here and based on principles of resonance, regarding a possible natural explanation for psychic powers. In later years, Mitchell has developed a "dyadic" model of paired opposites-mind/matter, life/death, etc.-that he also covers here and that owes as much to quantum physics' wave/particle duality as to Taoism's yin/yang. Mitchell isn't afraid to go out on a limb; his contention that the universe "intended" to evolve to higher levels, for example, goes against mainstream Western science. He grounds his ideas in data and reason, however, making this a strong offering for those who enjoy the books of Larry Dossey, Ken Wilber and others pushing the envelope of the science/spirit paradigm. BOMC, QPB and One Spirit selections. <BR>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>Apollo 14 astronaut Mitchell offers a vision in which technology and intuition are harmonized in pursuit of a more advanced consciousness. When Mitchell was hurtling back to earth after walking on the moon in 1971, he had a profound sense that all things are interconnected and that the universe is an intelligent process with which we need to link up. We hear how Mitchell began a career as a fighter pilot in the years following WW II, switched to NASA with the hope of being part of the new space program, and came to know the legendary Wernher von Braun, whom he believes was a true visionary rather than a Nazi opportunist. Mitchell tells how, while returning to earth, he carried out a private ESP experiment that seemed to yield positive results. Subsequently, he founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences, in order to test paranormal phenomena scientifically. We hear of Uri Geller's ability to bend spoons at a distance and of how Mitchell's own mother had her eyesight restored by American psychic Norbu Chen--until she realized that Chen was not a Christian and her near-blindness returned. Mitchell concludes that our own consciousness and beliefs are profoundly part of reality. He offers us a tour of Western thought from Aristotle to Newton, arguing that intuition and science were divorced until the advent of Einstein and quantum physics. We hear a lot about synchronicity, left and right brain, and the concept that psychic events are quantum exchanges in the brain that link us with the larger world. Unfortunately, Mitchell's insights, exciting but frequently obscure, depend excessively on one-sided generalizations about European philosophy and on his espousal of Joseph Campbell's views on religion. A stimulating attempt to reinvent the wheel. -- Copyright ®1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.

Many people write about food storage from their accumulating of food storage during easy times. They have a knowledge of it, but haven't had to really live it. I haven't written about food storage because of our abundance, but because we've had to live from our food storage out of necessity. We lived through that F-4 tornado that hit our house. While the tornado didn't completely destroy our home, we were displaced by it. Having food storage in our house allowed me to literally pack up three week's worth of food and take it to the hotel in which the insurance company was putting us up. I didn't have to think about food or menus or about money to eat out every meal. This knowledge gave me the freedom to focus on getting things settled with the insurance company. I had the freedom to keep my kids going and to deal with them not feeling safe. I had the freedom to run to different places to sign documents or make the different phone calls to deal with the devastation the storm wreaked on our home. Since that time, I've lived through two other life-changing events. I was an eye-witness to the Ferguson riots. No matter which side of the equation you come down on, it was life-changing and eye-opening. I also lived through an armed standoff with a knife-wielding man during my family's time at a local homeschool chess club. This taught me the importance of knowing how to react before something happens, so you get it right. You don't have time to think things over. Each of these things taught me a new level of self-sufficiency and preparedness. I never knew what life was going to throw at me, but my journey to self-sufficiency started with food storage and grew beyond my wildest imaginings.

While mathematics itself may be a formidable subject for many, the lives and accomplishments of history's greatest mathematicians - from Pythagoras to Cantor - offer fascinating reading.<BR>In this delightful and informative recounting, for example, we learn how Pascal's life was abruptly changed by a family of fanatical bonesetters, how Descartes was influenced by three dreams, and how the scholarly Swiss Leonhard Euler (whose famous conjecture was finally disproved in 1959, after 177 years) almost ended up in the Russian navy.<BR>Here, too, are Cardano, the gambler who becomes the 16th century's most fashionable doctor; Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss, often considered the three greatest mathematicians of all times; Lobatchevsky, the inventor of non-Euclidean geometry; and the tragic Galois, a founder of modern higher algebra.<BR>In addition to a wealth of interesting and informative anecdotes, presented in a delightfully conversational style, the author offers lucid, accessible explanations of these thinkers' invaluable contributions to the edifice of modern mathematical thought and to man's understanding of himself and his universe.

Located in southeastern Harford County, Edgewood was established in the mid-1800s as a small village around a train station.<BR><BR>It remained small until 1917, when the government took over thousands of acres to create the Edgewood Arsenal military complex. Thousands came to build the arsenal on land previously known for having fertile farms, gentlemen's waterfowl hunting clubs, and one of the earliest meeting places for Methodists in America. World War II brought an even greater increase in military personnel and civilians. Later, numerous housing developments replaced obsolete off-post government buildings. The creation of Route 40 through Edgewood in 1939 and 1940 and the Edgewood exit on Interstate I-95 in 1963 brought travelers and spurred new business.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>In 2009, Joseph F. Murray began a quest to uncover and preserve the history of Edgewood for his granddaughters. His daughter Amy L. Stuempfle and her father-in-law, Arthur K. Stuempfle, both Edgewood residents, readily joined him. Using the best images graciously provided by local residents and the local US Army historian and original photographs from a long defunct newspaper, Edgewood is a pictorial mosaic of the community and its attractions from the earliest days through the 1970s.

An "incredibly timely" global history journeys from the Ukrainian steppe to the American prairie to showÂ how grain built and toppled the world's largest empires (Financial Times).<BR>Â <BR>To understand the rise and fall of empires, we must follow the paths traveled by grain--along rivers, between ports, and across seas. In Oceans of Grain, historian Scott Reynolds Nelson reveals how the struggle to dominate these routes transformed the balance of world power.<BR>Â <BR>Early in the nineteenth century, imperial Russia fed much of Europe through the booming port of Odessa, on the Black Sea in Ukraine. But following the US Civil War, tons of American wheat began to flood across the Atlantic, and food prices plummeted. This cheap foreign grain spurred the rise of Germany and Italy, the decline of the Habsburgs and the Ottomans, and the European scramble for empire. It was a crucial factor in the outbreak of the First World War and the Russian Revolution.<BR>Â <BR>A powerful new interpretation, Oceans of Grain shows that amid the great powers' rivalries, there was no greater power than control of grain.<BR>Â <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Original and intriguing...[Nelson] makes a strong case that the wheat trade's contribution to history has not been given its due."âWall Street Journal<BR><BR>"Scott Reynolds Nelson in his grippingÂ Oceans of Grain: How American Wheat Remade the World...is quite serious about the world-ordering power of wheat. Moreover, his grain obsession is infectious. You begin the book a sober reader, calmly appreciating the complexity of historical causation, and you finish it a raving wheat monomaniac."âDaniel Immerwahr, New York Review of Books<BR><BR>"An incredibly timely history... Nelson makes a persuasive case that grain production, storage, transport and trade was the defining factor in the rise and fall of civilisations from Rome to Byzantium to the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Russia..."âFinancial Times<BR><BR>"[A] sweeping and timely new history...vitally provocative."âIrish Times<BR><BR>"Readable, original and provocative, this is a book that deserves attention."âDavid Abulafia, The Spectator<BR><BR>"Oceans of Grain is provocative. Well researched and readable, Nelson has written a book that will fascinate both professional historians and regular folk."<BR>Â âAmerican Essence<BR><BR>"Oceans of Grain is an eye opening feat of historical reconsideration."âSmoke Signals<BR><BR>"In the vein of other groundbreaking historical revisionist books, Oceans of Grain runs a fine toothed comb through history to tell an unexpected tale of what caused some empires to crumble while others survived and thrived: grain. ...much as he does in his previous book, Steel Drivin' Man, Reynolds Nelson introduces new key actors that shed important light on the story. A quick read despite its length, Oceans of Grain's reinterpretation of a humble commodity's history makes a case that wheat has had as much of an impact on our country and our planet as cotton--and that the fight for the power of grain is far from over."âCivil Eats<BR><BR>"A sweeping and timely new history...vitally provocative."âIrish Times<BR><BR>"American cotton changed the world in the first half of the nineteenth century, American wheat in its second half. Scott Reynolds Nelson's globe-spanning exploration of the powers of a humble grain to topple empires, enable industrialization, build cities, and redirect trade flows is the kind of commodity history one wishes for: attentive to politics, connected as well as comparative in perspective, and with a knack for telling details. After reading this fast-paced book, the wars, revolutions, and empires of the nineteenth century will never seem the same."âSven Beckert, author of Empire of Cotton<BR><BR>"Nelson's signature mastery of scale is on full display in Oceans of Grain. Here we watch him play out the revolutionary implications of the American seizure of the international wheat market in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War. This remarkable book rearranges what you think you know about the United States and the world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."âStephanie McCurry, Columbia University<BR><BR>"Nelson reveals the deep international career of wheat as a maker and breaker of empires and of people from Roman times until the twentieth century. Oceans of Grain is a book of astounding reach and depth, wholly original, gripping to read, and destined to become an instant classic. Rice and maize should be so lucky."âJames C. Scott, author of Against the Grain<BR><BR>"Oceans of Grain is the best work of history I have read in a very long time. Witty and wise, it reveals how conspirators and heads of state, workers and entrepreneurs, and philosophers and economistsÂ turned the human struggle for daily bread into wars and empires, revolutions and conquests, feasts and famines. It takes readers from the granaries and ancient trade pathways of Europe to the US Civil War and the overthrow of slavery, the founding of empires, the slaughterhouses of the First World War and the Russian Revolution, and, finally, to our contemporary, interconnected, and profoundly unequal world. Along the way, Scott Reynolds Nelson introduces us to the individuals who made and remade this world. Some are welcome new acquaintances and others--like Abraham Lincoln and Vladimir Lenin--are shown in such new light that it feels as if we are meeting them for the first time."âAngela Zimmerman, George Washington University<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Scott Reynolds Nelson is the UGA Athletics Association professor of the humanities at the University of Georgia. He is a Guggenheim fellow and the author of five books, including Steel Drivin' Man, which received the Merle Curti Social History Award and the National Award for Arts Writing. Nelson lives in Athens, Georgia.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Across entire verticals of the economy the new normal is the recurring revenue business. Charging customers on a monthly basis, firms with this model have to play by an entirely new set of rules, rules which generally favor the customer over the seller. But this new model also opens up fantastic opportunities to provide and extract more value from the relationship as well. To create that value business needs to move away from a hunting mindset to a farming mindset. That change is the new paradigm of Customer Success. Many business leaders have heard of Customer Success but few understand what it really means to run their business from the Customer Success standpoint. Even fewer have the experience to build the Customer Success function and optimize its performance. As a pioneer in the field of Customer Success, Guy Nirpaz is acknowledged as one of the earliest proponents of this business realignment. In "Farm Don't Hunt" Guy breaks down the intellectual underpinnings of Customer Success as a theory and quickly moves to providing pragmatic, actionable advice for orienting your business around this new model.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Guy loves people, and technology and has dedicated his career to improving the way in which people do business. Prior to starting Totango he worked in the space of real-time big data as EVP of Engineering at GigaSpaces, and Chief Architect at Mercury. Fun Fact: Guy moonlights as a lead guitarist in a rock band based out of his garage in Palo Alto.

From the bestselling authors and hosts of "The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe," a high-tech roadmap of the future in their beloved voice, cracking open the follies of futurists past and how technology will profoundly change our world, redefining what it means to be human.<BR><BR>Our predictions of the future are a wild fantasy, inextricably linked to our present hopes and fears, biases and ignorance. Whether they be the outlandish leaps predicted in the 1920s, like multi-purpose utility belts with climate control capabilities and planes the size of luxury cruise ships, or the forecasts of the '60s, which didn't anticipate the sexual revolution or women's liberation, the path to the present is littered with failed predictions and incorrect estimations. The best we can do is try to absorb the lessons from futurism's checkered past, perhaps learning to do a little better.<BR><BR>In THE SKEPTICS' GUIDE TO THE FUTURE, Steven Novella and his co-authors build upon the work of futurists of the past by examining what they got right, what they got wrong, and how they came to those conclusions. By exploring the pitfalls of each era, they give their own speculations about the distant future, transformed by unbelievable technology ranging from genetic manipulation to artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Applying their trademark skepticism, they carefully extrapolate upon each scientific development, leaving no stone unturned as they lay out a vision for the future.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Steve Novella and crew are serious, knowledgeable nerds. They use their critical thinking skills to analyze what is and isn't possible . . . or likely. Along with some remarkable insights, they've written a little science-based fiction of their own that is a delight to read. It's a well-researched, well-reasoned reference book."âBill Nye, CEO, the Planetary Society<BR><BR>NAMED A BEST SCIENCE BOOK OF 2022 BY BARNES & NOBLE<BR><BR>"[A]n entertaining evaluation of futurism. . . The result is pop science done right."âPublishers Weekly, starred review<BR><BR>"A gimlet-eyed look at the promises of technology and futurists past. . . An intriguing if bet-hedging work of futurology that calls into question the whole business of futurology itself."âKirkus Reviews<BR><BR>"A fun overview of both the current state of modern science and a general survey of the history of futurism."âBooklist<BR><BR>"I think that anyone who has been fascinated with the future, as I assume most people have at one time or another, should check out The Skeptics Guide to the Future. . . [I]t gives such an interesting take and view in which we should all look at the future. The realist perspective created more hope in me because it felt like the trajectory presented was achievable because of the building blocks already around."âCosmic Circus<BR><BR>PRAISE FOR SKEPTICS' GUIDE TO THE UNIVERSE<BR><BR>"A lively, engaging, and very timely guide to navigating a world rife with misinformation and pseudoscience. This book will give you the tools to ferret out nonsense and confront your own biases-and hopefully change a few minds along the way."âJennifer Oullette, author of Me, Myself, and Why and The Calculus Diaries<BR><BR>"[Novella] pulls no punches in his attack on the misinformation, myths, and biases that surround us. Aided here by several writing associates, the author demonstrates his vast experience explaining the mechanisms of deception and the tactics used by pseudoscientists. Presented as "one giant inoculation against bad science, deception, and faulty thinking," the book succeeds superbly."âKirkus (starred review)<BR><BR>"Empowering and illuminating, this thinker's paradise is an antidote to spreading anti-scientific sentiments. Readers will return to its ideas again and again."âPublishers Weekly (starred review)<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Dr. Steven Novella is an academic clinical neurologist at Yale University School of Medicine and is host and producer of "The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe" (SGU). He also co-hosts "Alpha Quadrant 6," a science-fiction review show.

Its sessions were held from the ninth of November to the seventh of December, 1884, and were comprised of twelve decrees. The Third Council is most noteworthy for the vigorous Catholic school building campaign which it spawned, commanding all parishes to provide Catholic education. It also produced the popular Baltimore Catechism for schoolchildren.

Thomas Paine was the impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, and this volume brings together his best-known works: Common Sense, The American Crisis, Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, along with a selection of letters, articles and pamphlets that emphasizes Paine's American years. "I know not whether any man in the world," wrote John Adams in 1805, "has had more influence on its inhabitants or affairs for the last thirty years than Tom Paine." The impassioned democratic voice of the Age of Revolution, Paine wrote for his mass audience with vigor, clarity, and "common sense." This Library of America volume is the first major new edition of his work in 50 years, and the most comprehensive single-volume collection of his writings available. Paine came to America in 1774 at age 37 after a life of obscurity and failure in England. Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet for the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him prosecuted in England, imprisoned and nearly executed in France, and hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. In Common Sense, Paine set forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during "the times that try men's souls" in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. Among the many other items included in the volume are the combative "Forester" letters, written in a reply to a Tory critic of Common Sense, and several pieces concerning the French Revolution, including an incisive argument against executing Louis XVI. Rights of Man (1791-1792), written in response to Edmund Burke's attacks on the French Revolution, is a bold vision of an egalitarian society founded on natural rights and unbound by tradition. Paine's detailed proposal for government assistance to the poor inspired generations of subsequent radicals and reformers. The Age of Reason (1794-1795), Paine's most controversial work, is an unrestrained assault on the authority of the Bible and a fervent defense of the benevolent God of deism. Included in this volume are a detailed chronology of Paine's life, informative notes, an essay on the complex printing history of Paine's work, and an index.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Paine is one of those who proved the pen is mightier than the sword. Included here are several of the writings that forged the spirit of our nation, including Common Sense, The Crisis, The Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, and Other Pamphlets, Articles, and Letters.

"It's quite a life, Patterson's, and this fizzing, funny, often deeply moving memoir is a perfect way to understand the dizzying world of a best-selling writer." --Daily Mail <BR><BR>"Damn near addictive. I loved it . . . that Patterson guy can write!" -Ron Howard<BR><BR>THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER--How did a kid whose dad lived in the poorhouse become the most successful storyteller in the world?<BR><BR>On the morning he was born, he nearly died. <BR><BR>His dad grew up in the Pogey- the Newburgh, New York, poorhouse. <BR><BR>He worked at a mental hospital in Massachusetts, where he met the singer James Taylor and the poet Robert Lowell. <BR><BR>While he toiled in advertising hell, James wrote the ad jingle line "I'm a Toys 'R' Us Kid." <BR><BR>He once watched James Baldwin and Norman Mailer square off to trade punches at a party. <BR><BR>He's only been in love twice. Both times are amazing. <BR><BR>Dolly Parton once sang "Happy Birthday" to James over the phone. She calls him J.J., for Jimmy James. How did a boy from small-town New York become the world's most successful writer? How does he do it? He has always wanted to write the kind of novel that would be read and reread so many times that the binding breaks and the book literally falls apart.

Gray's Clinical Photographic Dissector of the Human Body, by Drs. Marios Loukas, Brion Benninger, and R. Shane Tubbs, helps you take a clinical approach to the study of anatomy. This unique dissection guide uses full-color photographs rather than anatomical drawings to orient you more quickly in the lab, and points out the clinical significance of each structure and every dissection you make. You will also find valuable information on several emergency procedures used today to further reinforce the clinical correlations. With 1,300+ photos, this resource is a great way to learn or review anatomy and its relevance to clinical practice.<BR><BR>Easily relate anatomy structures to clinical conditions and procedures.<BR><BR>Perform dissections with confidence by comparing the 1,350 full-color photographs to the cadavers you study.<BR><BR>Understand the pertinent anatomy for 18 common emergency procedures such as lumbar puncture and knee aspiration.<BR><BR>Depend on the same level of accuracy and thoroughness that have made Gray's Anatomy the defining reference on this complex subject, thanks to the expertise of Dr. Marios Loukas, a leading authority in the worldof clinical anatomy.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"I wish I could have used this book when I took gross anatomy. It is a welcome combination of the two-book system my peers and I used -- one photographic atlas and one diagrammatic dissector. As medical students, we live on details and technicalities. When I took anatomy, we spent an inappropriate amount of time trying to match the drawings of anatomical structures to the cadaver at hand. One of the strengths of this atlas is a well-defined ratio of text to photographs. While traditional dissectors rely on dotted lines and artistic renderings, this photographic dissector offers a follow-along flip-book to dissection.Â  This photographic dissector is superior to both the standard dissector and the photographic atlas in the way that each section carefully maintains an anatomical landmark in each stepwise dissection photograph, helping in students' orientation to the evolving dissection views. I hope the second edition of this dissector incorporates some of the traditional diagrammatic methods. While I would still choose this dissector over any of the others available, as photographs are infinitely superior to artist renditions, I would still benefit from the occasional overlaid guidelines, instructional arrows, or other schematics adding instructional graphics to some of the more challenging dissections. Lastly, while there are lengthy descriptions and numerous labels in each image, I hope that the second edition will include bolding of the terms that are the new focus in the image sequence."- Mike Green, BS, BFA(Midwestern University) Doody Review: 82/100<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Dr. Marios Loukas was appointed Chairman of the Department of Anatomical Sciences at St. Georges University Medical School in 2008. He is responsible for managing the anatomy department, developing curriculum, supervising research and inspiring scholarly activities. Under his guidance, the department publishes approximately 70 to 80 academic papers a year.

All rights reserved.<BR>ONE<BR><BR>"Don't touch me!" Lauren Wagner screamed. Still caught in the web of her nightmare, she shoved at the small hand that held her arm. Jennifer, her younger sister, fell to the ground atop a scattering of pine needles. But Jennifer quickly sprang to her feet and reached out once more.<BR>"Jenny," Lauren said, disgusted when she saw what she had done. Her T-shirt was drenched with sweat and her heart was pounding. She gave Jennifer a quick hug. "Are you OK? I didn't mean to push you. I was having a nightmare."<BR>"I'm fine," Jennifer said, more serious than startled.<BR>"I'm sorry." Lauren busied her hands over her sister's clothes. She realized she was trembling, and had to make a conscious effort to stop. Jennifer watched her closely, her clear blue eyes alert.<BR>"You called someone, Lauren," she said. "Whose name did you call?"<BR>Lauren hugged her thirteen-year-old sister again, tighter this time, and buried her face in Jennifer's brilliant hair. The chair she had dozed off in rocked forward on the forest floor. "Was I talking in my sleep?" she asked. "I had the strangest dream."<BR>Jennifer undid Lauren's hands and took a step back. Behind her, the orange light of the evening sun shone on the tops of the surrounding pine trees. Wash Lake, a hundred yards off to their left, was a deep blue, calm and clear in the quiet of the forest. The fragrance of wild dandelions and blooming sunflowers was in the air. Yet in that moment it seemed to Lauren that Jennifer was not standing in the beautiful mountains of Wyoming, but in another place, a place where there was little beauty, and no sweet smells. Jennifer's gaze was far away and troubled.<BR>"Whose name did you call?" Jennifer repeated.<BR>Lauren forced a laugh and squeezed Jennifer's shoulders. "You just startled me, is all. That's why I jumped. My dream--why, I can't even remember it. It was nothing. It was only a nightmare."<BR>Jennifer looked doubtful. She gestured to stump near Terry's cabin. "I was reading a book. Then you called me."<BR>Lauren wanted to change the subject. "What book are you reading?" She started to run her fingers through Jennifer's long blond hair, but Jennifer shook her head and stepped away.<BR>"Just a story," she said. "It's nothing." Turning, she walked over to the stump and picked up her book. She sat down and began to read, without looking back up.<BR>Lauren frowned. Jennifer was a paradox, she thought, full of joy one moment, troubled and serious the next. Sometimes she wondered if Jennifer spent too much time with her nose in books. It was not unusual for Jennifer to go through five novels a week, all kinds of novels: science fiction, fantasy, adventure books, and westerns. Lauren never censored them. She didn't understand why Jennifer hadn't answered her question.<BR>But that reminded Lauren. She still had to read Terry's article. Terry Hayes was her fiancé, a newspaper reporter for the Houston Herald. Lauren picked up the paper from where it had fallen when she jumped up out of her nightmare. The front page was dominated by a color picture that Terry had taken of the crew members of America's first expedition to Mars. Lauren was in the middle, down in front.<BR>It was odd--she had been looking at the picture when she had fallen asleep. She knew her nightmare had had something to do with Mars. She called over to Jennifer. "Terry wanted me to critique the second part of his article, but I've only got the first part. Didn't you tell me that boyfriend of yours could get me a copy of the Herald?"<BR>Jennifer glanced up and blushed. "He's not my boyfriend."<BR>"Then why were you holding his hand?"<BR>"I didn't hold his hand. I didn't."<BR>"I understand. He was holding your hand."<BR>Jennifer had forgotten her book. "Were you spying on us?"<BR>"I wouldn't dream of it."<BR>"Right," Jennifer said sarcastically.<BR>Lauren was thoughtful. "But I do seem to remember seeing him kiss you. Accidentally seeing you, that is. It was on the cheek."<BR>"He never!" Jennifer said indignantly.<BR>"On the cheek but not far from your lips. A very long kiss, if my memory serves me correctly."<BR>Jennifer seemed about to make another sharp retort when she burst out laughing. "You're just jealous because he thinks I'm prettier than you."<BR>Lauren blinked, surprised. "He said that?"<BR>Jennifer nodded, smug. Of course, Lauren had to agree with the young man. Jennifer was an exceptional beauty, one of those children who could turn a dozen heads in a crowded mall. Her features showed an interesting play of contradictory genes. They were clearly defined, yet also delicate, waiflike. She spent many hours outdoors, and as a result always had a decent tan, which went well with her blue eyes. The latter possessed a cerulean clarity that was seldom found except in newborn babies. But it was her hair that was her crowning glory: long and curly, naturally blond to the point of looking bleached. On sunny days it swirled around her sleek shoulders like a protective aura. To look at Jennifer was to see something beautiful; it was as simple as that.<BR>"You told me his name," Lauren said. "What is it? Dave?"<BR>"Daniel."<BR>"I see, Daniel. Not Dan or Danny, but Daniel."<BR>"I thought calling him by his proper name would make him feel more important." Jennifer explained.<BR>"Did you read that in a book?"<BR>Jennifer shook her head.<BR>"Are you sure?" Lauren asked.<BR>"No.Yes! I like that name, Daniel."<BR>Lauren eyed her sister's discarded book. "What are you reading anyway?"<BR>Jennifer bowed her head and touched the book's dull red cover. "Just something I found at the library."<BR>"And it's a secret?"<BR>Jennifer hesitated. "It's a love story."<BR>Lauren laughed. "I bet Danny--Daniel told you to read it. I'm going to make sure Terry watches you closely the next two years." Instantly, Lauren regretted mentioning her leaving, although it was something they had talked about enough. She knew Jennifer preferred not to discuss the expedition to Mars while they were in Wyoming. It was strange--her sister had no trouble with the subject when they were in Houston. Lauren added. "Will Daniel be here soon?"<BR>Jennifer brightened. "He said yesterday that he'd be here at six. He's going to show me one of his weapons."<BR>"Sounds like a date to me." Lauren checked the position of the sun. "He should be here any minute. Do you want me to take a walk?"<BR>"You don't have to," Jennifer said, although she quickly stood, like maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea. Lauren took the hint and got up, tucking Terry's newspaper in her white shorts. The air was warm and dry, and the feel of the sun on her bare legs was delicious.<BR>"I need the exercise," Lauren said. "What did you mean, he's going to show you one of his weapons? Is he in the service?"<BR>Jennifer giggled. "No. He's only fourteen. He collects weapons. He's part Indian."<BR>Lauren nodded. "That explains it. Is he going to show you how to shoot a bow and arrow?"<BR>"No. He's bringing an elephant rifle."<BR>"Great. My little sister's chasing an Indian who hunts elephants in a pine forest." Jennifer thought that was funny. Lauren continued, "I bought some Cokes in town yesterday, if you want to give your friend a drink. And Jenny, if Terry comes, have Daniel give a blast on his gun."<BR>"What if he doesn't bring any bullets?"<BR>Lauren was already among the trees, the pine needles crackling under her bare feet. "Then have him send up smoke signals," she called.<BR>Soon Lauren reached the shore of the lake, where she turned west, heading in the direction of the sun. It was not long before she entered the shallows and broke into a jog, and then began to run. She loved to race along the shore and feel the sand between her toes and the water splashing up her back. She ran for five hard minutes, and covered at least a mile--for she was in excellent shape, and had always been fast on her feet. She only stopped when she came to wide stream, which from experience she knew to have the slipperiest rocks in all of Wyoming. She had a tiny dent on the back of her skull courtesy of the stream.<BR>She was hot, and the lake was tempting. Unfortunately, she didn't have her suit, and her shorts and T-shirt felt like lead weights when they were wet. Plus she was something of a celebrity these days, what with the launch date only a couple of weeks away. It wouldn't do to have one of NASA's leading public relations specimens to be photographed nude.<BR>Then again, it might do wonders for their budget.<BR>Lauren listened closely for a minute, scanning the beach in both directions and finding no one. What decided her in the end was the thought of not seeing any green or open water for two whole years. She had to embrace nature while she could, and if someone did snap her picture, at least she would look like she was having fun. She had her shorts and shirt off in five seconds, and was in water over her head in another ten. It was not merely cold, it was liquid ice, and she loved it. Wash Lake was a half mile across, and she swam strongly toward the center. Had it not been for her bare bottom, she would have tried to swim to the far shore.<BR>But her run must have taken more out of her than she realized. Close to the middle of the lake, she found herself working hard, and decided to roll over on her back and take it easy. She drifted along for some time, paddling just enough to stay afloat. Out of the corners of her eyes, the trees looked ten times more distant than they really were, as they always did from surface level. The sky began to darken as the sun slipped behind a forested ridge, and the water temperature finally made itself felt on her muscles. After all the money NASA had invested in her training, it would be a bummer is she drowned. Yet it was with regret that she rolled onto her belly and began to swim toward the shore. She knew even then that she would remember this swim while she was walking across the sands of Mars.<BR>Out of the water, Lauren plopped down on a boulder beside the stream and slipped back into her clothes. The evening air held the day's warmth--she didn't mind the damp material clinging to her skin. She had left the paper in the sand. She picked it up and flipped to Terry's article.<BR><BR>WAR OF THE WORLDS<BR>By Terry Hayes, Reporter<BR><BR>Houston. On October 28, 2002, almost two years ago, two Russian spacecraft touched down on Mars, in the mountainous region known as Tharsis. The expedition was headed by Dmitri Maximov. For ten days his men explored the area, beaming to Earth incredible footage of the alien landscape. But then, on November 6, all contact with them was lost. Two days later, communication was also lost with Carl Bensk, the sole cosmonaut aboard the mother ship, in orbit around Mars. Since that time, neither the men on the planet, nor Carl Bensk, have been heard from. They are presumed dead.<BR>What happened to them? Five major theories have been put forth to explain their disappearance: 1) mechanical failure; 2) natural calamity; 3) alien infection; 4) alien monsters; and 5) insanity.<BR>Of these five theories, the first is thought most likely, but only in the improbable context of the others. The chance of both communication systems on board the landers failing simultaneously is astronomically small. Furthermore, the two craft landed almost a mile apart. If one had exploded during takeoff, the other would have been spared. For the mechanical theory to hold water, the mother ship would also have had to suffer a major system failure. The theory breaks down under even the most casual scrutiny.<BR>A natural calamity? Mars is now known to have sandstorms, and earthquakes are much more common there than on Earth. It snowed often while the Russians were in communication. The Tharsis region is also volcanic, or at least it has been in the past. However, satellites circling Mars reported no unusual weather during the period in question, and no obvious eruptions. In either case, the orbiting ship should have been unaffected, and Carl Bensk should still have returned home.<BR>Life has never been proven to exist on Mars. Nevertheless, a variety of microscopic organisms could be flourishing in the planet's atmosphere and soil undetected. Our investigation of Mars is still in its infant stages. As is well known, a human being exposed to a virus or a bacteria from an alien environment would have no natural defense. Skeptics of this theory, however, point out that such an infection would have had to strike at lightning speed to prevent the cosmonauts from radioing Earth. Given the harsh Martian environment, advanced forms of life are considered impossible. Plus, of course, none of the Russians saw anything that looked alive. But even if such creatures did exist, they would once again have had to kill at an incredible speed to prevent at least a warning from being sent to Earth. Certainly, no alien's arm could have reached all the way into space and murdered Carl Bensk, not unless the alien was part of an advanced civilization that had mastered the art of invisibility.<BR>It must be clear by now that the fundamental criticism of all these theories centers on Mr. Bensk. That is, except for the fifth theory--insanity. The Russians...<BR>* * *<BR>Lauren dropped the paper with a start as a loud explosion echoed across the lake. Daniel must have brought bullets, she thought. Terry must have arrived. She jumped to her feet and raced down the sandy beach. She ran fast, as hard as she had on the run out, and was gasping for air by the time she caught sight of Jennifer and her friend.<BR>But Terry hadn't arrived, after all. Daniel was simply target shooting, using the cans of Coke she had bought yesterday. A handsome boy, he was dark complexioned, and had a remarkably well developed physique for a fourteen-year-old. The rifle he had cocked to his shoulder looked as if it could blow the head off a dinosaur.<BR>"I told him you would come if he shot the gun," Jennifer said with a laugh. "Lauren, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is my big sister, Lauren. She's going to Mars in a couple of weeks."<BR>So what else is new, Lauren thought.<BR>Daniel offered his hand. "I know that. I saw you on TV last week. That's great that you're going to Mars. I'd like to go there myself someday."<BR>Lauren shook his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Daniel. You'll get to go. In another twenty years they'll probably have tourist flights to Mars."<BR>"But Lauren's going to be one of the first there," Jennifer said.<BR>"The Russians were the first ones," Daniel said. He added, "Of course, they didn't come back."<BR>"No they didn't," Lauren agreed.<BR>"That was a lousy way for me to say hello," Daniel said wisely. "Sorry."<BR>"That's all right," Lauren said.<BR>"It's pretty cold there, isn't it?" Daniel asked.<BR>"Our suits will keep us warm," Lauren said. "At least, that's what NASA tells us."<BR>"I tried on her helmer," Jennifer broke in.<BR>"What was it like?" Daniel asked, interested.<BR>"It didn't fit. It was like wearing a bowl over your head. It was fun, though."<BR>"We'll see you on TV when you're there, won't we?" Daniel asked.<BR>"Yes," Lauren said. "Except you'll see everything twenty minutes after it happens. Even traveling at the speed of light, out radio signals will take that long to reach Earth. You probably know all that stuff."<BR>"Yeah," Daniel said. "Pretty long ways to travel. Jenny says you'll be gone two years."<BR>Lauren nodded. Jennifer explained, "The trip home takes the most time. They have to wait for the Earth to swing back around the sun. Hey, Daniel, did you hear about the computer that runs their ship? His name's Friend. I think that's a neat name."<BR>"I read about him in the papers," Daniel said. "Is it true he really knows how to think?"<BR>Lauren smiled. "He thinks just fine, as long as he doesn't have to make a decision. He only knows what he has been programmed to know, like a PC in your home. But since that's just about everything mankind has learned in the last five thousand years, he's pretty smart."<BR>"He talks, doesn't he ?" Daniel asked.<BR>"Like you and me," Lauren said.<BR>"I talked to him over the radio," Jennifer said.<BR>"What did he say?" Daniel asked.<BR>"I asked if he enjoyed living in a spaceship, and he said, 'Yes, Miss Wagner.'"<BR>"He called you Miss Wagner?" Daniel asked.<BR>"He's very polite," Jennifer said. "But I didn't talk to him that much. I couldn't think of anything, you know, that I wanted to say to a machine."<BR>Daniel shook his head, impressed. "All this stuff is so far out." He inspected Lauren more closely. "Lauren, how come your hair's all wet? Were you swimming in the lake?"<BR>"Yeah," she said. "I swam all the way out."<BR>"How come your shorts didn't get wet?" Daniel asked.<BR>Lauren shrugged. He was a big boy. "Because I took them off."<BR>Jennifer blushed. Daniel nodded. "I used to go swimming naked all the time," he said.<BR>"You did?" Jennifer asked, amazed.<BR>Daniel shrugged. "Sure." He addressed Lauren. "I hope you didn't go swimming alone."<BR>"I was alone, yes." He had his eyes on her, and Lauren wasn't sure what he was thinking. But he seemed a nice enough kid. "Why not?"<BR>Daniel spoke gravely. "A girl my age drowned last week. She went out too far and cramped up. At least that's what my brother thinks happened to her. The water's pretty cold. I had to dig the hole for her."<BR>Lauren grimaced. "You what?"<BR>Jennifer looked uncomfortable. She said quickly, "Daniel sometimes helps out at Olive Grove Cemetery. He usually just does gardening. You know the place, Lauren? You've seen it on the road in."<BR>"You helped bury her?" Lauren asked, not really wanting to know.<BR>"Yeah," Daniel said. "The owner doesn't have much equipment. Sometimes I help him put the coffins in the hole. You have to be careful. We had a lid pop open on us once. Hell--I'm being gross. I should shut up."<BR>"I'm a doctor," Lauren said. "I'm hard to gross out."<BR>Daniel stepped to his bike. A canvas bag stuffed with papers straddled the handlebars. "I got a copy of that Houston paper for you," he said, pulling it out of the bag and handing it to her.<BR>"That's great," Lauren said. She pointed to the row of three Coke cans sitting atop a boulder approximately two hundred yards away. The light had begun to fail, and even under perfect conditions, Daniel would have had to be an excellent shot to hit them. But Lauren wouldn't be surprised if he could. He had a cool confidence about him. She could see why Jennifer liked him. "Were you target shooting?" she asked.<BR>"I was just showing off," he replied, swinging the stock of the rifle into the soft of his shoulder.<BR>"Jenny tells me you collect weapons," Lauren said.<BR>Daniel eyed along the rifle's barrel. The rifle wasn't equipped with a telescopic sight. "It's in my blood, being a savage Indian and all."<BR>"You're not savage," Jennifer said.<BR>Daniel winked at her, and Lauren caught a spark in his eyes which made her smile to herself. The guy liked Jennifer, which should have been no surprise, except Jennifer had few friends at school. Those she did have, she had known for many years. Jennifer was affectionate and warm, and most of the time happy, but unusually guarded for a thirteen-year-old.<BR>"What do you have in your collection?" Lauren asked.<BR>"A Civil War cannon," Daniel said, dropping to one knee, "a dozen Chinese Knives, an old Spanish sword, and a boomerang. I'll have to show you how to use it sometime, Jenny. But my real prize is a crossbow my brother found. Yeah, he just found it, in the mountains in Switzerland. Shoots as straight as this rifle here." Daniel paused. "Plug your ears."<BR>Lauren and Jennifer did so. Daniel pulled the trigger. The bang was loud, even with their ears covered. A spark flashed on the boulder where the cans sat. Daniel had missed. He took a deep breath, held it, and then fired again. The can on the right exploded. The fizzling foam flowed over the stone. Jennifer cheered briefly, then quickly replaced her fingers to her ears. Daniel fired once more, demolishing the can in the middle.<BR>"Incredible," Lauren said, impressed. In the deepening twilight, she could hardly see the remaining can, and she had better than twenty-twenty vision.<BR>Jennifer patted Daniel on the back. "My warrior."<BR>Daniel was nonchalant. He offered Jennifer his rifle. "Would you like to give it a shot?"<BR>Jennifer backed up, startled. She shook her head. "I don't think so."<BR>Daniel turned to Lauren. "Want to put the last can out of its misery?"<BR>"Yeah." Lauren took the gun, feeling an odd pleasure in its weight. This was how wars got started, she knew, with a fascination with powerful toys. She crouched down and tried to steady her aim, using her knee for support. Then Jennifer touched her side. "What is it?" she asked, not pleased at the interruption.<BR>"Don't use that," Jennifer said.<BR>"Huh?" Lauren squinted. For a moment, she had lost sight of the can.<BR>"Don't fire the gun," Jennifer said.<BR>Slightly annoyed, Lauren asked, "Why not?"<BR>I see you brought the fire.<BR>"What did you say?" Lauren asked Daniel.<BR>"I didn't say anything," he said.<BR>"I thought you said to fire...see that I fire. Hmmm. Somebody said something."<BR>"I didn't say anything," Daniel repeated.<BR>Lauren turned her attention to Jennifer, who was standing perfectly still, watching her. "What's your problem?" Lauren asked.<BR>Jennifer was long in answering. "You shouldn't use that."<BR>"Why not?" Lauren asked. "Since when did you become a pacifist for the sake of Coke cans?"<BR>Jennifer cocked her head to the side, as if she were listening with her whole body. Then suddenly she raised an eyebrow. "Terry's almost here," she said.<BR>"Are you sure?" Lauren asked. She paused. "I don't hear a thing."<BR>"Listen," Jennifer said.<BR>Lauren did so, and still didn't hear anything. Daniel had eyes like an eagle and Jennifer ears like a bat. Their kids would be superhuman. Daniel finally knelt and pressed his ear to the ground.<BR>"A car is coming," he said. "Is it your boyfriend?"<BR>Lauren quickly returned the rifle to Daniel. "My fiancé," she said absently. "He's a reporter." She looked at Jennifer, who was staring at the sky. For no, reason, Lauren felt a sudden chill.<BR>"I know him," Daniel said. "Terry Hayes. He and my brother are friends. Mr. Hayes used to come here a lot on vacation years ago. I probably met him before you two did."<BR>Jennifer slowly shook herself, seemingly returning to Earth, and smiled faintly. "We're like one big family," she said. "We all know each other."<BR>Lauren finally heard Terry's car for herself. "Oh, Christ," she said. "My hair's a mess. I have to put my clothes on." She jogged toward the cabin. At the porch steps she turned and called. "Hide that gun, Daniel. Terry hates the sight of guns."<BR>"Really?" he said. "All right, sure." Daniel dashed to the trees to stash the rifle.<BR>"They remind him of wars," Jennifer said thoughtfully.<BR>"I wouldn't be surprised if they did," Lauren muttered, skipping up the steps.<BR>I see you brought the fire.<BR>Why did I think that? Lauren asked herself. She didn't know. She didn't care. She hurried inside. God, she was going to Mars in a couple of weeks.<BR><BR>Copyright © 1992 by Christopher Pike

The ultimate Portis: for the first time in one collector's volume, the complete fiction and collected nonfiction of the author of True Grit<BR><BR>Summer reading recommendation in THE WASHINGTON POST, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL SENTINEL<BR><BR>"Charles Portis is one of the great pure pleasures available in American literature." --Ron Rosenbaum<BR><BR>"Like Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Berger's Little Big Man, Charles Portis's True Grit captures the naïve elegance of the American voice." --Jonathan Lethem<BR><BR>"No living Southern writer captures the spoken idioms of the South as artfully as Portis does." --Donna Tartt<BR><BR>"His fiction is the funniest I know." --Roy Blount, Jr.<BR><BR>Twice adapted as a film, first in a version starring John Wayne and then by the Coen Brothers, True Grit is a wonder of novelistic perfection, told in the unforgettable voice of 14-year-old Mattie Ross as she sets out to avenge her murdered father in a quest that brings her out of her native Arkansas and into the wilds of the Choctaw Nation of the 1870s. One of the great literary Westerns, it is also a novel that has invited comparison with The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. <BR><BR>Portis's deadpan debut novel Norwood (1966) is, like True Grit, the story of a quest, though here the stakes are far lower: an auto mechanic from Texas embarks on a madcap journey to New York City to try and recover $70 owed to him from an Army buddy. <BR><BR>A book that according to Roy Blount Jr. "no one should die without having read," The Dog of the South (1979) is yet a third saga of pursuit, this time all the way to Central America. Ray Midge is on the road looking for the man who has run off with his car (and of somewhat less interest to him, his wife.)<BR><BR>Masters of Atlantis (1985) conjures the fictional cult of Gnomonism and takes an uproarious plunge into the dark heart of conspiratorial thinking and schismatic in-fighting.<BR><BR>Gringos (1991), set in Mexico, follows an expatriate ex-Marine in his search to find a UFO hunter gone missing in the Yucatan, amid a supporting cast of archaeologists, drug-addled hippie millenarians, and the son of the "bravest dog in all Mexico."<BR><BR>A generous gathering of the nonfiction reveals Portis's skills as a reporter, above all in his coverage of the Civil Rights Movement; his appreciation of Arkansas history and landscape, as in "The Forgotten River"; and his poignancy as a family memoirist, on display in his recollection "Combinations of Jacksons."<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"A new volume by the Library of America, edited by the Arkansas journalist Jay Jennings, gathers all these characters and more, collecting Portis's five novels together with his short stories and some of his journalism, including the parody of an advice column that ran in this magazine. It's absurdly fun to follow his oddballs and their odysseys, but something more than fun, too. Portis's genius went beyond character in the strictly literary sense, to reveal something about moral character and many somethings about the character of this country."--Casey Cep, The New Yorker<BR><BR>"It is hard to imagine a greater or more valuable pleasure-per-ounce package than the collected works of Charles Portis." -- The New Republic<BR><BR>"Now the five novels, the memoir, and some short stories, essays and newspaper articles have been gathered together in one tidy volume edited by Jay Jennings, and installed where they belong, in the pantheon of American letters, the Library of America... The comedy is ineffable, inextricable from its context, the ready-for-anything American mindscape. As P.G. Wodehouse is to England and Flann O'Brien to Ireland, so Charles Portis is to America: a writer whose comedy strikes a celestial chord and whose characters, to quote Evelyn Waugh on Wodehouse, "live in their own universe like the characters of a fairy story.""--Katherine Powers, Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"There won't be a parade, but perhaps there should be."--Arkansas Democrat-Gazette<BR><BR>"A meticulously curated new compendium from the Library of America, which collects his five novels and assorted other works, allows for a fresh opportunity to reckon with his slippery, unsettled legacy ... In one sense, a Library of America edition of Portis's work is a kind of surprise ending. It's tempting to point out the disjunction between the author's fundamental outsider stance and his postmortem embrace by the institutional intelligentsia." --The Washington Post<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Charles Portis (1933-2020) is the author of five novels, a handful of short stories, a play, and several essays, along with journalism written early in his career. His debut novel, Norwood, was published in 1966 and was made into a movie in 1970. His second and best-known novel, True Grit, has been twice adapted for the screen, most recently by the Coen brothers in 2010; in 2013 it was named a National Endowment for the Arts Big Read Library Selection. <BR><BR>Jay Jennings is Senior Editor at the Oxford American, having formerly been a writer for Sports Illustrated and a features editor at Tennis magazine. His book Carry the Rock: Race, Football, and the Soul of an American City was published in 2010. A native of Little Rock and a longtime friend of Portis, he is the editor of Escape Velocity: A Charles Portis Miscellany (2012) and the co-author (with Graham Gordy) of an as-yet-unproduced film adaptation of Portis's novel The Dog of the South.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church reads "often the texts of Sacred Scripture are not quoted literally but merely indicated as a reference ('Cf.') in the footnotes. For a deeper understanding of those passages, the reader should go to the texts themselves. These Biblical references are a working tool for catechesis." <BR><BR>This Companion to the Catechism of the Catholic Church Book of References contains all the passages of Sacred Scripture referred to in the Catechism arranged according to the paragraphs in which the references are made. <BR><BR>But that is only a beginning. The Catechism also refers to conciliar texts, papal documents, writings of the Fathers and of the Saints. There are more than 3,600 of these references extending from the earliest credal formulations of the ancient Church to the documents of Vatican II and beyond to the magisterial teaching of Pope John Paul II. The Book of References includes all the texts referred to arranged, along with the Scripture passages, according to the paragraphs of the Catechism in which they are referred. <BR><BR>This Book of References is a valuable instrument in teaching, understanding, and implementing the Catechism. It is a handy one-volume reference library for use with the Catechism. <BR><BR>"... I ask the Church's pastors and the Christian faithful to receive this Catechism in a spirit of communion and to use it assiduously in fulfilling their mission of proclaiming the faith and calling people to the Gospel life." <BR>ï¿½ Pope John Paul II

The Didache Bible (RSV-2CE) presents extensive commentaries, based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church, for each of the books of the Holy Bible. The Didache Bible also includes numerous apologetical inserts to assist the reader in understanding the Church's teachings on current issues. After publishing the books of The Didache Series, Midwest Theological Forum set out to fill a need for a Catholic edition of Sacred Scripture with explanatory and apologetical commentaries based on the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The publication of the Didache Bible, based on these principles, fulfills the desire of Pope St. John Paul II as expressed in his Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum: The Catechism of the Catholic Church... is a statement of the Church's faith and of catholic doctrine, attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture, the Apostolic Tradition and the Church's Magisterium. I declare it to be a sure norm for teaching the faith. (no. IV) The Didache Bible (RSV-2CE) is

With the smash hit Bones about to enter its seventh season and in full syndication-and her most recent novel, Spider Bones, an instant New York Times bestseller-Kathy Reichs is at the top of her game.<BR><BR><B class=h1>Q&A with Dr. Kathy Reichs<BR><BR>In this bonus Q&A, the scribe behind Tempe Brennan takes questions on NASCAR, extremist groups, Tempe's love life, and the difference between writing a novel and penning a script for the TV show Bones on FOX. <BR><BR>Q: Flash and Bones begins with the discovery of a body in a barrel of asphalt in a dump next to the Charlotte Motor Speedway, and characters from the racing world become implicated in the drama. What drew you to NASCAR as a backdrop? Are you yourself a racing fan? <BR><BR>A: Prior to writing Flash and Bones, I had only passing knowledge of auto racing, having attended one event way back in the gray dawn of history. But almost every Charlottean knows a player in the game--be it a team owner, a mechanic, a sponsor, or a driver. It's hard not to get caught up in the excitement each May and October when hundreds of thousands converge on our burg for big races. Like Daytona or Darlington, Charlotte is an epicenter for the sport. And, as Tempe explains in the book, stock car racing originated with bootlegging in the Carolina mountains during Prohibition. <BR><BR>I ended up writing NASCAR into the novel because of my long-time friend Barry Byrd, himself a huge racing enthusiast. Each time I began a new Temperance Brennan novel Barry would suggest that NASCAR would provide a rich background for a story. I finally realized he was right. Barry offered to introduce me to Jimmy Johnson and his team, to take me to the track, to include me with the gang attending the All Star Race and the Coca Cola 600. <BR><BR>Barry followed through on that promise. I met track owners and managers, sports journalists, pit crew chiefs, and fans who had driven their Winnebagos from Portland, Houston, Teaneck, and Nashville. Thanks to Barry and the Smith family I enjoyed a top to bottom tour of the Charlotte Motor Speedway. My fascination with the adjacent landfill was, I fear, a source of some dismay. <BR><BR>Q: Flash and Bones takes place entirely in Tempe Brennan's hometown of Charlotte. Spider Bones, on the other hand, begins in Montreal, where Tempe occasionally works, then moves to Hawaii. Other books have taken Tempe to Chicago, Israel, and Guatemala. How do you decide where to set your next novel? In what city do you spend most of your own time these days?<BR><BR>A: Setting is a living, breathing part of each story I write. When Tempe travels, her destination is always a place that I know well, one in which I have plied my trade or spent time doing research.<BR><BR>I work and live in Charlotte, so Tempe does too. Like her, I am a commuter, shifting regularly from North Carolina to Quebec, where I consult to the Laboratoire de Sciences Judiciaires et de Médecine Légale in Montreal. Yep. I have the mother lode of frequent flier miles.<BR><BR>In Spider Bones Tempe heads to Hawaii to pursue a case for JPAC, the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command, the United States military facility dedicated to identifying the remains of servicemen and women who have died far from home. Easy choice. I consulted for this lab for many years.<BR><BR>In Grave Secrets Tempe exhumes a mass grave in Guatemala. In the year 2000 I was invited to do the same by the Guatemalan Foundation for Forensic Anthropology.<BR><BR>In Bones to Ashes a case takes Tempe to Tracadie, New Brunswick. This setting was suggested by an exhumation and analysis I performed for an Arcadian family living in that province.<BR><BR>In 206 Bones Tempe flies to Chicago. Another no-brainer. That's where I was born. <BR><BR>You get the idea. It's better to observe first hand than to make things up.<BR><BR>Q: Another dominant theme of Flash and Bones is right-wing extremism, a subject about which you've written before. Members of a white supremacist group figure as suspects in the book. How did you become interested in these factions of American society?<BR><BR>A: Extremist ideas do not offend me. In my view, people are free to believe what they will. Extremism that hurts others offends me greatly. <BR><BR>In Cross Bones I wrote of religious extremism--belief systems that refuse to accept the legitimacy of differing worldviews. In that story events take Tempe to Israel and bring her into contact with fringe groups who use violence to impose their ideologies and customs on others. <BR><BR>Political extremism can be equally dangerous, whether coming from the left or the right. In recent years hatred and intolerance have led to deadly attacks by domestic terrorists in the United States. Ted Kacyznski, the Unabomber; Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City bombers; Eric Rudolph, the Olympic Park bomber. Such individuals choose to kill their fellow citizens based on their own warped definitions of morality. <BR><BR>After years on the run, Rudolph was arrested while digging through a dumpster in western North Carolina, about a four hour drive from Charlotte. I wondered who else might be hiding in the woods and back roads of my state. In Flash and Bones, I imagine a group of people who come from the extreme mold of Eric Rudolph and his narrow-minded brethren. <BR><BR>Preferring comfort in numbers, some right wing fanatics form clubs or militias. That's the case in Flash and Bones. Tempe is drawn into the world of an extremist group and must learn their philosophy and decipher their code of conduct in order to determine their role in a cold case that disturbs her greatly. <BR><BR>Q: Over the course of Flash and Bones, Tempe develops a flirtatious relationship with Cotton Galimore, the head of security at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. Her old flame, Lieutenant-Detective Andrew Ryan, and sometime suitor and Charlotte attorney Charlie Hunt only make minor appearances in the story. How do you decide what Tempe's romantic life is going to be like in each novel? Can you give readers any hints about where it might go in the future?<BR><BR>A: It's true. Tempe's love life is in a bit of a muddle. Andrew Ryan is preoccupied with his daughter Lily, who is in drug rehab. And miles away. Charlie Hunt is absorbed in a complex legal case. Miles away in another sense. <BR><BR>Enter Cotton Galimore, strong, intelligent, and smoking hot. Sadly, Galimore's past isn't exactly spick and span. Joe Hawkins distrusts him. Skinny Slidell loathes him. And the guy is cocky as hell. <BR><BR>But the heart wants what the heart wants. Inexplicably, Tempe is drawn to the disgraced ex-cop. Is Galimore really as bad as her colleagues say? Should she steer clear as everyone advises? <BR><BR>Nope. No spoilers here.<BR><BR>Q: Flash and Bones, as with all your books, contains unique forensic twists: the body found at the dump is lodged in a barrel of asphalt, which Tempe must painstakingly dismantle. Later, chemical tests at the CDC reveal the presence of a surprising toxin in the remains. What was the inspiration for these forensic discoveries? Have you seen such corpses in your real-life work, or, in writing your novels, do you imagine the strange possibilities of homicides you haven't yet encountered? <BR><BR>A: I am like a scavenger, always on the lookout for a snack. But instead of food, it's criminal twists I'm after. I keep my eyes and ears open for interesting characters, bizarre case elements, and cutting edge science. A Temperance Brennan plot may derive from any number of sources. <BR><BR>Starting point. I draw ideas from forensic anthropology analyses that I perform myself. My own cases. <BR><BR>Move one circle out. The LSJML (my Montreal gig) is a full spectrum medico-legal and crime lab. While there I am able to observe what goes on around me, to learn about the newest thing in ballistics, toxicology, pathology, or DNA. <BR><BR>Continue outward. Forensic scientists love to talk to each other about their cases. Colleagues often suggest ideas for Temperance Brennan stories based on investigations in which they have been involved. <BR><BR>Occasionally a plot twist is inspired by a presentation I attend at a professional conference. The annual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences provides particularly rich fodder. Articles in research journals also get the old brain pumping. <BR><BR>From my own case load, and then from conversing, listening, watching, and reading, I get what I think of as "nugget" ideas, my core story concepts. Then, for both legal and ethical reasons, I change everything--names, dates, places, personal details. I then play the "what if?" game, and spin the nugget off into multilayered fiction. <BR><BR>Q: In addition to writing the Temperance Brennan novels (and now the young adult novels featuring Tempe's niece), you've also written a script for the FOX series Bones, based on your books. How does writing a TV script differ from writing your novels? Is one harder than the other?<BR><BR>A: I am a producer on Bones. One of many. Just look at our credits. Mainly, I work with the writers, answering questions, providing bone clues, correcting terminology. Over the course of six seasons, I have read more than one hundred and thirty scripts. Though a television script is quite different from a book, there is some commonality. <BR><BR>For me the similarity between a Temperance Brennan novel and a Bones teleplay lies in structure. My books typically have a lot going on--an A story, a B story, maybe even a C. Ditto a Bones episode. <BR><BR>In Flash and Bones Tempe is asked to identify a body found in a barrel. That's the A story. Simultaneously, she is drawn into the search for a missing teenage couple. The B story. And, all the while, there's her complicated love life. C story. <BR><BR>In the season five Bones episode that I wrote, "The Witch in the Wardrobe," two sets of remains are discovered in a burned out house. The witch in the wardrobe turns out to have been dead for quite some time. A story. The witch under the foundation is identified as a recent homicide victim. B story. Angela and Hodgins go to jail (and love rekindles). C story. The structures are very similar, you see. <BR><BR>On the other hand, a novel and a script differ in many ways. For example, with film or television there's no need for detailed description of setting or action. Those features are right there in front of your eyes. A screenplay or teleplay is all about dialogue, character, and story line. <BR><BR>Another difference involves the creative experience. When I write a novel, I am the stereotypical loner working at my keyboard in isolation. No one helps me. No one approves or disapproves my work. Not so the television writer. <BR><BR>Once a story idea (kind of like my "nugget" concept) is accepted, the next step is called "breaking the story." For one to three weeks the entire Bones writing staff brainstorms together, hammering out an outline act by act, scene by scene, working on erasable white boards that cover the walls of the writers' room. The process is collective, and it is exhilarating. <BR><BR>(The Bones writing team is awesome. Josh Berman, Pat Charles, Carla Kettner, Janet Lin, Dean Lopata, Michael Peterson, Karine Rosenthal, Karyn Usher. Thanks for your patience, guys.) <BR><BR>The completed script outline is then "pitched"--in the case of Bones to Hart Hanson, our genius creator and executive producer. <BR><BR>Once the outline is approved, the writer then "goes to script." That means back to the lonely keyboard to produce what is called the writer's draft. That stage takes one to three weeks. Unless the show is behind schedule. In that case, well, good luck. <BR><BR>Then there are re-writes. And more re-writes. Studio draft. Network draft. Production draft. <BR><BR>In the end it is amazing to see your episode actually being shot, with all the actors, the director, the gaffers, the grips, and the best boys. Lights! Camera! Action! <BR><BR>Almost as amazing as seeing your baby on the printed page.

#1 New York Times Bestselling author - The spellbinding classic that started it all - Book I of the Vampire Chronicles<BR><BR>Here are the confessions of a vampire. Hypnotic, shocking, and chillingly erotic, this is a novel of mesmerizing beauty and astonishing force--a story of danger and flight, of love and loss, of suspense and resolution, and of the extraordinary power of the senses. It is a novel only Anne Rice could write.<BR><BR>Praise for Interview with the Vampire<BR><BR>"A magnificent, compulsively readable thriller . . . Rice begins where Bram Stoker and the Hollywood versions leave off and penetrates directly to the true fascination of the myth-the education of the vampire."--Chicago Tribune<BR><BR>"Unrelentingly erotic . . . sometimes beautiful, and always unforgettable."--Washington Post<BR><BR>"If you surrender and go with her . . . you have surrendered to enchantment, as in a voluptuous dream."--Boston Globe<BR><BR>"A chilling, thought-provoking tale, beautifully frightening, sensuous, and utterly unnerving."--Hartford Courant <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>In the now-classic novel Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice refreshed the archetypal vampire myth for a late-20th-century audience. The story is ostensibly a simple one: having suffered a tremendous personal loss, an 18th-century Louisiana plantation owner named Louis Pointe du Lac descends into an alcoholic stupor. At his emotional nadir, he is confronted by Lestat, a charismatic and powerful vampire who chooses Louis to be his fledgling. The two prey on innocents, give their "dark gift" to a young girl, and seek out others of their kind (notably the ancient vampire Armand) in Paris. But a summary of this story bypasses the central attractions of the novel. First and foremost, the method Rice chose to tell her tale--with Louis' first-person confession to a skeptical boy--transformed the vampire from a hideous predator into a highly sympathetic, seductive, and all-too-human figure. Second, by entering the experience of an immortal character, one raised with a deep Catholic faith, Rice was able to explore profound philosophical concerns--the nature of evil, the reality of death, and the limits of human perception--in ways not possible from the perspective of a more finite narrator.<BR><BR>While Rice has continued to investigate history, faith, and philosophy in subsequent Vampire novels (including The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the Damned, The Tale of the Body Thief, Memnoch the Devil, and The Vampire Armand), Interview remains a treasured masterpiece. It is that rare work that blends a childlike fascination for the supernatural with a profound vision of the human condition. --Patrick O'Kelley

Synopsis:<BR><BR>A comprehensive look at four of the most famous problems in mathematics<BR><BR>Tales of Impossibility recounts the intriguing story of the so-called problems of antiquity, four of the most famous and studied questions in the history of mathematics. First posed by the ancient Greeks, these compass and straightedge problems--squaring the circle, trisecting an angle, doubling the cube, and inscribing regular polygons in a circle--have served as ever-present muses for mathematicians for more than two millennia. David Richeson follows the trail of these problems to show that ultimately, their proofs--demonstrating the impossibility of solving them using only a compass and straightedge--depended upon and resulted in the growth of mathematics.<BR><BR>Richeson explores how celebrated luminaries, including Euclid, Archimedes, Viète, Descartes, Newton, and Gauss labored to understand the problems of antiquity, and how many major mathematical discoveries were related to these explorations. Though the problems were based in geometry, their resolutions were not, and had to wait until the nineteenth century, when mathematicians had developed the theory of real and complex numbers, analytic geometry, algebra, and calculus. A little-known mathematician named Pierre Wantzel and Ferdinand von Lindemann, through his work on &#x3c0;, finally determined the problems were impossible to solve. Along the way, Richeson provides entertaining anecdotes connected to the problems, such as how the Indiana legislature passed a bill setting an incorrect value for &#x3c0;, and how Leonardo da Vinci made elegant contributions to the puzzles.<BR><BR>Taking readers from the classical period to the present, Tales of Impossibility demonstrates how four unsolvable problems captivated mathematical thinking for centuries.<BR><BR>Book Description:<BR><BR>A book on four unsolvable mathematical problems that have captivated scholars since antiquity.

A New York Times / National Bestseller<BR><BR>"America's funniest science writer" (Washington Post) Mary Roach explores the science of keeping human beings intact, awake, sane, uninfected, and uninfested in the bizarre and extreme circumstances of war.<BR><BR>Grunt tackles the science behind some of a soldier's most challenging adversaries-panic, exhaustion, heat, noise-and introduces us to the scientists who seek to conquer them. Mary Roach dodges hostile fire with the U.S. Marine Corps Paintball Team as part of a study on hearing loss and survivability in combat. She visits the fashion design studio of U.S. Army Natick Labs and learns why a zipper is a problem for a sniper. She visits a repurposed movie studio where amputee actors help prepare Marine Corps medics for the shock and gore of combat wounds. At Camp Lemmonier, Djibouti, in east Africa, we learn how diarrhea can be a threat to national security. Roach samples caffeinated meat, sniffs an archival sample of a World War II stink bomb, and stays up all night with the crew tending the missiles on the nuclear submarine USS Tennessee. She answers questions not found in any other book on the military: Why is DARPA interested in ducks? How is a wedding gown like a bomb suit? Why are shrimp more dangerous to sailors than sharks? Take a tour of duty with Roach, and you'll never see our nation's defenders in the same way again.

Beloved, best-selling science writer Mary Roach's "acutely entertaining, morbidly fascinating" (Susan Adams, Forbes) classic, now with a new epilogue.<BR><BR>For two thousand years, cadavers - some willingly, some unwittingly - have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They've tested France's first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender confirmation surgery, cadavers have helped make history in their quiet way. "Delightful-though never disrespectful" (Les Simpson, Time Out New York), Stiff investigates the strange lives of our bodies postmortem and answers the question: What should we do after we die?<BR><BR>"This quirky, funny read offers perspective and insight about life, death and the medical profession. . . . You can close this book with an appreciation of the miracle that the human body really is." -Tara Parker-Pope, Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"Gross, educational, and unexpectedly sidesplitting." -Entertainment Weekly

This genre-organized comprehensive literature anthology provides an integrated approach to writing about literature. <BR><BR>This book includes chapters on writing, research, and literary criticism in addition to over 519 literary selections for study. <BR><BR>For individuals interested in reading literature and learning to write about literature. This text is ideal for anyone seeking a comprehensive collection of fiction, poetry, and drama. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR><BR>How important is writing in your course? <BR><BR>When Edgar Roberts taught literature and composition, a large part of his courses involved essay-writing assignments. He dedicated a substantial amount of his class time to explaining how students should prepare their writing assignments. He discovered that the more he described to his students what he wanted, and the more time he spent explaining things, the better the final essays turned out to be. There was a direct correlation between the way he made his assignments and the quality of student work he received. <BR><BR>Professor Roberts started to hand out directions to his students, saving him valuable classroom and preparation time. Over the years, he tested each assignment in his own classes. To meet the needs of the literature and composition course, Professor Roberts seamlessly integrated writing-about-literature instruction with a comprehensive literature anthology. The result is the book you hold in your hands. <BR><BR>Literature: An Introduction to Reading and Writing is founded on the principles of writing about literature. It is not an afterthought and it is not treated as a separate chapter or appendix; but rather, it is the carefully integrated philosophy of Professor Roberts' approach to teaching literature and composition.

This fully illustrated journey into the world of the supernatural provides invaluable guidance to those who wish to uncover what lies beyond the grave. This fascinating book includes tales of ordinary families whose lives have been destroyed by malevolent poltergeists, haunted lunatic asylums and apocalyptic messages from the dead channelled through a succession of mediums. These spine-tingling modern ghost stories have never seen the light of day before. The author has interviewed ghost hunters and paranormal investigators for up-to-date material that is as unnerving as it is authentic. There is no better introduction to the spirit world.

Joy is the all-purpose cookbook. There are other basic cookbooks on the market, and there are fine specialty cookbooks, but no other cookbook includes such a complete range of recipes in every category: everyday, classic, foreign and de luxe. Joy is the one indispensable cookbook, a boon to the beginner, treasure for the experienced cook, the foundation of many a happy kitchen and many a happy home.<BR><BR>Privately printed in 1931, Joy has always been family affair, and like a family it has grown. Written by Irma Starkloff Rombauer, a St. Louisan, it was first tested and illustrated by her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, and subsequently it was revised and enlarged through Marion's efforts and those of her architect husband, John W. Becker. Their sons-Ethan, with his Cordon Bleu and camping experiences, and Mark, with his interest in natural foods-have reinforced Joy in many ways.<BR><BR>Now over forty, Joy continues to be a family affair, demonstrating more than ever the awareness we all share in the growing preciousness of food. Special features in this edition are the chapter on Heat, which gives you many hints on maintaining the nutrients in the food you are cooking, and Know Your Ingredients, which reveals vital characteristics of the materials you commonly combine, telling how and why they react as they do; how to measure them; when feasible, how to substitute one for another; as well as amounts to buy. Wherever possible, information also appears at the point of use.<BR><BR>Divided into three parts, Foods We Eat, Foods We Heat and Foods We Keep, Joy now contains more than 4500 recipes, many hundreds of them new to this edition-the first full revision in twelve years. All the enduring favorites will still be found. In the chapter on Brunch, Lunch and Supper Dishes there are also interesting suggestions for using convenience and leftover foods. Through its more than 1000 practical, delightful drawings by Ginnie Hofmann and Ikki Matsumoto, Joy shows how to present food correctly and charmingly, from the simplest to the most formal service; how to prepare ingredients with classic tools and techniques; and how to preserve safely the results of your canning and freezing.<BR><BR>Joy grows with the times; it has a full roster of American and foreign dishes: Strudel, Zabaglione, Rijsttafel, Couscous, among many others. All the classic terms you find on menus, such as Provencale, bonne femme, meunière and Florentine, are not merely defined but fully explained so you yourself can confect the dish they characterize. Throughout the book the whys and wherefores of the directions are given, with special emphasis on that vital cooking factor-heat. Did you know that even the temperature of an ingredient can make or mar your best-laid plans? Learn exactly what the results of simmering, blanching, roasting and braising have on your efforts. Read the enlarged discussion on herbs, spices and seasonings, and note that their use is included in suitable amounts in the recipes. No detail necessary to your success in cooking has been omitted.<BR><BR>Joy, we hope, will always remain essentially a family affair, as well as an enterprise in which its authors owe no obligation to anyone but to themselves and to you. Choose from our offerings what suits your person, your way of life, your pleasure-and join us in the Joy of cooking.<BR><BR>Because of the infinite patience that has gone into the preparation of Joy of Cooking, the publishers offer it on a money-back guarantee. Without question there is no finer all-purpose cookbook. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR><BR>Since its first private printing in 1931, The Joy of Cooking has been teaching Americans how to cook. Craig Claiborne calls it "a masterpiece of clarity" and Julia Child says it's the one book she'd keep if she could only have one English title on the shelf. The nearly 5,000 recipes are handily organized by meal and ingredient, and no cooking instruction goes unexplained, so you can finally understand the difference between poaching and braising. The book includes nutritional information as well as an extremely helpful list of measures and equivalents. You'll find a version of every recipe your mother ever cooked, along with straightforward instructions for cooking more exotic specialties such as turtles and muskrats.

For the 75th anniversary of D-Day, a deluxe collector's edition gathering two gripping masterpieces of military history.<BR><BR>Library of America presents two of the best books ever written about World War II in a deluxe collector's edition featuring 88 pages of photographs, full-color endpaper maps, rare archival material revealing how the books were written, and a new introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and historian Rick Atkinson (The Liberation Trilogy). The Longest Day tells the story of the Allies' greatest success, the Normandy invasions of June 6, 1944, Operation Overlord; A Bridge Too Far recounts perhaps their greatest failure, the catastrophic airborne invasion of Holland in September 1944, known as Operation Market Garden. Together, they reveal not only the twisting fortunes of war and the grand sweep and scale of the largest amphibious and airborne invasions ever mounted, but also the very real human experience of combat, the small but momentous individual acts that can change the course of history. No one has told these stories more powerfully than Cornelius Ryan.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the "Sliver of Infinity," reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison. Kelsier "snapped" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark.<BR><BR>Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot.<BR><BR>But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life. Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.<BR><BR>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?<BR><BR>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson<BR><BR>The Cosmere<BR><BR>The Stormlight Archive<BR>The Way of Kings<BR>Words of Radiance<BR>Edgedancer (Novella)<BR>Oathbringer (forthcoming)<BR><BR>The Mistborn trilogy<BR>Mistborn: The Final Empire<BR>The Well of Ascension<BR>The Hero of Ages<BR><BR>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series<BR>Alloy of Law<BR>Shadows of Self<BR>Bands of Mourning<BR><BR>Collection<BR>Arcanum Unbounded<BR><BR>Other Cosmere novels<BR>Elantris<BR>Warbreaker<BR><BR>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series<BR>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<BR>The Scrivener's Bones<BR>The Knights of Crystallia<BR>The Shattered Lens<BR>The Dark Talent<BR><BR>The Rithmatist series<BR>The Rithmatist<BR><BR>Other books by Brandon Sanderson<BR><BR>The Reckoners<BR>Steelheart<BR>Firefight<BR>Calamity<BR><BR>At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Sanderson's eerie second fantasy (after 2005's Elantris), set in a mist-haunted, ash-ridden world, pits Kelsier, "the Survivor of Hathsin," against the immortal Lord Ruler's 1,000-year domination of both the Great Houses and their serflike "skaa." Through Allomancy acquired in the Ruler's most hellish prison, Kelsier can "burn" 10 metals internally, fueling superhuman powers he uses to assemble rebels in a loose plan to destroy the nobility, the empire and the Lord Ruler himself. Kelsier uses Vin, a street urchin with the same Mistborn powers Kelsier possesses, to infiltrate the Great Houses' society, where she falls in love with philosopher prince Elend Venture. This mystico-metallurgical fantasy combines Vin's coming-of-age-in-magic and its well-worn theme of revolt against oppression with copious mutilations, a large-scale cast of thieves, cutthroats, conniving nobles and exotic mutants. The fast-paced action scenes temper Vin's interminable ballroom intrigues, while the characters, though not profoundly drawn, have a raw stereotypic appeal. (July) <BR>Copyright ® Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. <BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>The Sliver of Infinity, the Lord Ruler, is the locus of religious and temporal order in a world in which the skaa are slaves or worse. Half-skaa erstwhile thief Kelsior is the only person to survive and escape the Lord Ruler's most brutal prison, in which, however, he discovered he has the powers of the Mistborn, which are based on the internal "burning" of certain metals, all of which the Mistborn can use, while most others can burn only one. Now Kelsior plans his most daring raid ever, into the center of the palace to discover the secret of the Lord Ruler's power. Beforehand, his band finds the half-skaa orphan Vin in another thieving crew, where she's useful because she brings good luck. She is also Mistborn and, if she can master and learn to trust her powers, will enable Kelsior's crew to infiltrate the nobility and possibly overthrow the status quo. Intrigue, politics, and conspiracies mesh complexly in a world Sanderson realizes in satisfying depth and peoples with impressive characters.

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Brandon Sanderson, the Mistborn series is a heist story of political intrigue and magical, martial-arts action.<BR><BR>The impossible has been accomplished. The Lord Ruler -- the man who claimed to be god incarnate and brutally ruled the world for a thousand years -- has been vanquished. But Kelsier, the hero who masterminded that triumph, is dead too, and now the awesome task of building a new world has been left to his young protégé, Vin, the former street urchin who is now the most powerful Mistborn in the land, and to the idealistic young nobleman she loves. <BR><BR>As Kelsier's protégé and slayer of the Lord Ruler she is now venerated by a budding new religion, a distinction that makes her intensely uncomfortable. Even more worrying, the mists have begun behaving strangely since the Lord Ruler died, and seem to harbor a strange vaporous entity that haunts her.<BR><BR>Stopping assassins may keep Vin's Mistborn skills sharp, but it's the least of her problems. Luthadel, the largest city of the former empire, doesn't run itself, and Vin and the other members of Kelsier's crew, who lead the revolution, must learn a whole new set of practical and political skills to help. It certainly won't get easier with three armies - one of them composed of ferocious giants - now vying to conquer the city, and no sign of the Lord Ruler's hidden cache of atium, the rarest and most powerful allomantic metal. <BR><BR>As the siege of Luthadel tightens, an ancient legend seems to offer a glimmer of hope. But even if it really exists, no one knows where to find the Well of Ascension or what manner of power it bestows.<BR><BR>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson<BR><BR>The Cosmere<BR><BR>The Stormlight Archive<BR>The Way of Kings<BR>Words of Radiance<BR>Edgedancer (Novella)<BR>Oathbringer (forthcoming)<BR><BR>The Mistborn trilogy<BR>Mistborn: The Final Empire<BR>The Well of Ascension<BR>The Hero of Ages<BR><BR>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series<BR>Alloy of Law<BR>Shadows of Self<BR>Bands of Mourning<BR><BR>Collection<BR>Arcanum Unbounded<BR><BR>Other Cosmere novels<BR>Elantris<BR>Warbreaker<BR><BR>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series<BR>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians<BR>The Scrivener's Bones<BR>The Knights of Crystallia<BR>The Shattered Lens<BR>The Dark Talent<BR><BR>The Rithmatist series<BR>The Rithmatist<BR><BR>Other books by Brandon Sanderson<BR><BR>The Reckoners<BR>Steelheart<BR>Firefight<BR>Calamity <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"All the explosive action any adventure fan could want." âLocus<BR><BR>"Sanderson's entertaining second Mistborn novel begins after most fantasy series end, when the team of brave and cunning heroes find that holding on to power is even harder than overthrowing the previous tyrant. . . .

Tricked into releasing the evil spirit Ruin while attempting to close the Well of Ascension, new emperor Elend Venture and his wife, the assassin Vin, are now hard-pressed to save the world from Ruin's deadly Inquisitors, the insidious lethal mists called the Deepness and the increasingly heavy falls of black ash that threaten to bury the land and starve its inhabitants. As the duo search for the last of the former emperor's cache of atium, source of the strongest Mistborn energies, they battle Ruin's forces as well as monsters and prophetic powers. Sanderson's saga of consequences offers complex characters and a compelling plot, asking hard questions about loyalty, faith and responsibility. (Oct.) <BR>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. <BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>The Lord Ruler is dead, and Elend Venture is working on consolidating his rule. But the mist is becoming actively dangerous, ash falls almost constantly, and brutal earthquakes are shaking the world apart. The subtle, nearly omniscient Ruin is infiltrating both Elend's army and his opponents. Fortunately, the stubborn Vin vows to discover a way to destroy him. When failure seems imminent, help comes from unexpected quarters. Sanderson pulls loose ends together, explains vague prophecies, and produces the Hero of Ages, and the Mistborn trilogy (The Final Empire, 2006; The Well of Ascension, 2007; and this book) concludes satisfactorily. --Regina Schroeder

A definitive new biography of the Byzantine emperor Justinian Â <BR>Â <BR>Justinian is a radical reassessment of an emperor and his times. In the sixth century CE, the emperor Justinian presided over nearly four decades of remarkable change, in an era of geopolitical threats, climate change, and plague. From the eastern Roman--or Byzantine--capital of Constantinople, Justinian's armies reconquered lost territory in Africa, Italy, and Spain. But these military exploits, historian Peter Sarris shows, were just one part of a larger program of imperial renewal. From his dramatic overhaul of Roman law, to his lavish building projects, to his fierce persecution of dissenters from Orthodox Christianity, Justinian's vigorous statecraft--and his energetic efforts at self-glorification--not only set the course of Byzantium but also laid the foundations for the world of the Middle Ages.Â Â <BR>Â <BR>Even as Justinian sought to recapture Rome's past greatness, he paved the way for what would follow.â¯Â <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"AÂ wonderfully vivid and fluent study."âWall Street Journal<BR><BR>"A majestic, sparkling account of one of the most important rulers in history. Meticulously researched, beautifully written, filled with insights, this is modern history writing at its finest."<BR>Â âPeter Frankopan, New York Times-bestselling author of The Silk Roads<BR><BR>"Superb and gripping. Epic historical biography that brings the emperor to life with analysis and empathy and a work of scholarship filled with new ideas and revelations."<BR>Â âSimon Sebag Montefiore, New York Times-bestselling author of The World<BR><BR>"An expert, readable and thought-provoking biography of Justinian...This book is essential reading for anyone curious about later antiquity, and it will give profit and pleasure to those with broader interests."âLondon Review of Books<BR><BR>"Teases out...tensions and more in his new biography of Justinian, illuminating a central figure in a signal period in the history of the West."âNew Criterion<BR><BR>"In this comprehensive account...Sarris brings his subject's world to vivid life. The result is a clear-eyed view of a complex historical figure and his times."<BR>Â âPublishers Weekly<BR><BR>"Effortlessly erudite, lucidly written, with a sharp eye for the telling detail, Peter Sarris has written the great biography of the greatest of the Byzantine emperors."<BR>Â âRory Stewart, New York Times-bestselling author of The Places in Between<BR><BR>"Justinian's long life mirrored that of ancient Rome itself: Both rose from lowly origins to supreme power, survived revolt and conquered rivals, crafted laws, and erected mighty monuments, only to be worn down by insurgents, invaders, and plagues. In a stunning tour de force, Peter Sarris brings one of history's most momentous dramas back to life."<BR>Â âWalter Scheidel, author of The Great Leveler<BR><BR>"Justinian looms so large in the landscape of the ancient Mediterranean that it is almost impossible to take his measure. Yet Sarris has done so convincingly, offering a lucid and persuasive account of a ruler as invested in the mechanics of government as in waging wars of conquest. A remarkable achievement."<BR>Â âKate Cooper, author of Queens of a Fallen World<BR><BR>"Sarris's Justinian is magnificent. A vivid and authoritative biography of one of Rome's most fascinating rulers, Justinian is also a vibrant portrait of an entire world--a resurgent Roman Empire suddenly devastated by tragedy."<BR>Â âKyle Harper, author of The Fate of Rome<BR><BR>"Spectacularly good: a wonderfully colorful biography of the man who remade the Roman Empire. Sarris plunges us deep into a world of imperial conflict, religious paranoia, pandemics, and climate change while never losing sight of the extraordinary character at its heart. Based on decades of scholarship, this is the definitive history of the emperor and his times and a thrilling testament to the glories of Byzantium."<BR>Â âDominic Sandbrook, cohost of The Rest is History<BR><BR>"An important milestone in the study of Justinian and his time."âBryn Mawr Classical Review<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Peter Sarris is professor of late antique, medieval, and Byzantine studies at the University of Cambridge. He is author or editor of eight books on the history of late antiquity, the early Middle Ages, and Byzantium, including Byzantium: A Very Short Introduction. He lives in Shepreth, UK.â¯Â

Published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the last steps taken on the moon, this unique, definitive book about the Apollo missions reveals hundreds of extraordinary, newly-restored, and all-new images from the NASA archives that provide a never-before-seen perspective on the Apollo endeavors.<BR><BR>In Houston, Texas, there is a frozen vault that preserves the original NASA photographic film of the Apollo missions. For half a century, almost every image of the Moon landings publicly available was produced from a lower-quality copy of these frozen originals. Over the last few years, NASA image restorer Andy Saunders has been working hard. Taking newly available digital scans and applying pain-staking care and cutting-edge enhancement techniques, he has created the highest quality Apollo photographs ever produced. Never-before-seen spacewalks and crystal-clear portraits of astronauts in their spacecraft, along with startling new visions of the Earth and the Moon, offer astounding new insight into one of our greatest endeavors.<BR><BR>This is the definitive record of all Apollo missions and a mesmerizing, high-definition journey into the unknown.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Space nerds will geek out over this far-out coffee table book, which features hundreds of never-before-seen images from the Apollo missions, lovingly brought to life by NASA's photo restorer Saunders. Startling spacewalks, portraits of astronauts in their spacecraft and dazzling new views of the Earth and Moon give new insight and perspective on man's exploration of space."âNew York Post<BR><BR>"The new book, Apollo Remastered by Andy Saunders shows the Apollo lunar missions like you have never seen them before. The illuminating images are simply out of this world."âNew Scientist<BR><BR>"A weighty coffee table book that beams readers right into its cosmic world... pure magic, full of clarity, sharpness and color that makes readers feel like part of the team--a far cry from those grainy images that were broadcast on TV at the time."âBookPage<BR><BR>"Truly epic . . . Some of the scenes you'll recognize; they're among the most iconic photos ever taken. But others you will not have seen before; and certainly not in the detail that Andy has rendered them. They have a crispness and depth that makes you want to reach out and touch them."âBBC News<BR><BR>"Andy Saunders is a go-to guy for restoring photographs that seem beyond hope. His new book, Apollo Remastered, reveals what happened when this British imaging specialist turned his hand to humanity's ultimate adventure...However much you think you know the Apollo images, never have they been seen quite like this..."âNational Geographic UK<BR><BR>"NASA's Moon missions as you've never seen them before - remastered for a new century."âThe Guardian<BR><BR>"A masterpiece."âTim Peake, British ESA Astronaut<BR><BR>Andy Saunders's remastered images are so clear and real that they are the next best thing to being there...They are an exact representation of what I remember from my journey to the Moon on Apollo 16. These photos reveal very precisely what the Moon was really like.âCharlie Duke, Apollo 16<BR><BR>The images Andy Saunders has produced from the 50 year old original film are just incredible. I have personally checked the images in the book, and if you want to know what it was really like on the Apollo missions, then this is for you. The photographs capture the pioneering era I took part in perfectly, and the techniques Andy has used have brought out such fantastic detail from that old original film we took back in the 60s. Maintaining an accurate record of these historic moments is such important work not just now, after half a century, but also for future generations.âWalter Cunningham, Apollo 7<BR><BR>Seeing historians like Andy Saunders produce such cutting-edge results is incredible. . . Not only has Andy done a remarkable job bringing more details to light, but his incredible work has also created a lot of public excitement.âDr. Brian Odom, acting NASA Chief Historian<BR><BR>After five decades, it's very rare that something comes along from Apollo that genuinely surprises me... but this is truly special. It changes everything, in an instant.âMark McCaughrean, Senior Advisor for Science and Exploration, European Space Agency<BR><BR>Andy Saunders' remastered images leave me stunned. They give me chills. This is as close as any of us will get to joining the Apollo astronauts on their historic missions to the moon - and it's a lot closer than we ever thought possible. This book, like all of his work, is much more than a thrill to behold; it's a profound contribution to our understanding of humanity's exploration of the heavens.âJeff Shesol, author of Mercury Rising<BR><BR>Even though I worked for NASA for 40 years, I can only view the work Andy does in digital restoration of analog imagery as innovative, creative, and a gift to the world. The precision, the detail, and the validity of his work on the old film from early human spaceflight is breathtaking to me - such incredible valuable results and contributions to these historic events. âJim Lewis, Command Recovery Pilot, Liberty Bell 7<BR><BR>Andy Saunders' remarkable digital imaging skills are rewriting space history. Saunders is doing for Project Apollo what the James Webb Space Telescope has done for astronomy: bringing our greatest adventure into sharp and arresting focus.âGeorge Leopold, author of the Supersonic Life & Times Of Gus Grissom<BR><BR>A peerless photographic masterpiece - almost as audacious as Apollo itself. If you only buy one Apollo before the decade is out make sure it's this one! A total treasure to pore over for a lifetime.âDr. Chris Riley, BAFTA nominated writer, filmmaker and co-producer of In The Shadow Of The Moon<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Andy Saunders is one of the world's foremost experts of NASA digital restoration. His work has been exhibited at museums, and appeared in BBC News, Daily Telegraph, Smithsonian's Air & Space Magazine, Ars Technica, The Washington Post, as well as in NASA's own archives.

"Recommended with confidence" by The Times Literary Supplement, this lively survey starts with simple arithmetic and algebra and proceeds by gradual steps through graphs, logarithms, and trigonometry to calculus and the world of numbers. Generations of readers have found it the ideal introduction to mathematics, offering accessible explanations of how theory arises from real-life applications.<BR>"The main object of this book is to dispel the fear of mathematics," declares author W. W. Sawyer, adding that "Many people regard mathematicians as a race apart, possessed of almost supernatural powers. While this is very flattering for successful mathematicians, it is very bad for those who, for one reason or another, are attempting to learn the subject." Now retired, Sawyer won international renown for his innovative teaching methods, which he used at colleges in England and Scotland as well as Africa, New Zealand, and North America. His insights into the pleasures and practicalities of mathematics will appeal to readers of all backgrounds.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>W. W.

"In the home office of the quiet town of Oerlinghausen, Germany, there sits a man reading on his gray chaise lounge chair. Sticking out of the man's book is a notecard with scribblings of his thoughts. On the floor next to the man sit piles of books and journal articles. The room's walls are bookshelves stocked with 11,000 titles of books, journals, and manuscripts. Yet the object drawing the most attention today is the thing resting on the floor next to the man's desk: a wooden notebox cabinet containing twenty-four drawers. This object, known in German as a 'Zettelkasten', translates to "notebox." This notebox has attracted fascination in recent years. People hold this man's mysterious notebox system as the "secret" to how this sociologist was so productive. And indeed, this man was productive. Niklas Luhmann (1927-1998) produced six-hundred academic papers and seventy books in approximately forty years (an astonishing amount). Unfortunately, as it stands today, Luhmann's notebox system is widely misunderstood. Many have developed their own interpretations of how it works. These Zettelkasten teachings are littered with phrases Luhmann never used, and rules Luhmann himself never even abided by! Furthermore, much of the system's "magic" has been lost in a makeshift attempt to export it into the digital age. In this book, Scott P. Scheper dives into the original nature of Luhmann's Zettelkasten: the analog version. Scheper uncovers four principles Luhmann identified that make it unique. This system (called an "Antinet Zettelkasten") contains many overlooked elements that made Luhmann's system so effective. After finishing this book, you will have an advanced understanding of the powerful knowledge system that will transform you into a more prolific learner, reader, researcher, and writer"--Back cover.

Roman emperors, Arab scholars, and early travellers were already drawn to and enchanted by the fascination of the land along the Nile. The pyramids of Giza, the temply-city of Karnak, or the Valley of the Kings with the grave of Tutankhamen even today maintain their extraordinary force of attraction.

Marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first moon landing, two former astronauts tell of the intense human drama behind the lunar race between two superpowers, and of the sacrifices and risks asked of the American crew.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>Shepard and the late Slayton, two of the original Mercury astronauts, here team up with two veteran space reporters to produce a firsthand account of the space program's early days. The narrative is at its best when it focuses on the astronauts' flight experiences-Shepard's brief Mercury flight, his lunar landing mission ten years later, and Slayton's long-delayed trip into space aboard the last Apollo mission in 1975. On the down side, its use of re-created conversations that pass as exposition weaken the narrative, making it sound more like a screenplay prospectus than a space history. For example, it is doubtful that John Glenn had to explain to his fellow astronauts what the Saturn launch vehicle was. One comes away wishing for more insight into what it was like to walk on the moon and less about the astronauts' pranks and peccadillos. Still, with the book's publication timed to coincide with this July's 25th anniversary of the first manned lunar landing, this title may see some demand.<BR>--Thomas Frieling, Bainbridge Coll., Ga.<BR>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>It's hard to believe, but most teens and people in their early twenties don't remember Americans walking on the moon. This book, written lovingly by two of the most respected astronauts in U.S. history, will remedy that. Journalists Jay Barbree and Howard Benedict organized the material, and they portray Shepard and Slayton as two close friends who shared the dream of many children of the 1960s: to fly in outer space. Sadly, Shepard, after becoming the first American in space in a mere hour's trip, developed inner ear problems that prevented him from going back, and Slayton's irregular heartbeat kept him from going at all. Meanwhile, President Kennedy escalated the space race to get a leg up on the Russians. Despite covering some of the same ground as Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff, Shepard and Slayton vividly portray the great bond uniting the original Mercury Seven. The most terrifying chapter describes the fire on the launchpad that killed three Apollo 1 astronauts, but problems on many flights (unbeknownst to TV viewers) were only solved by the skill of the astronauts as pilots. Shepard and Slayton are emphatic about environmental issues (having seen the Earth from a unique viewpoint), and Shepard's eventual moon shot is only topped by Slayton's emotional reaction to being cleared to fly the Apollo-Soyuz mission to dock with Russian cosmonauts, with whom he became fast friends. Expect much demand. Joe Collins<BR><BR>From Kirkus Reviews<BR>The story of America's space race with the Soviet Union and the scramble to put a man on the moon, by two who were there. Shepard and Slayton, both Mercury Seven astronauts, begin with a long, panting account of the Eagle's landing on the moon's surface, then backtrack to the beginning of the superpower missile competition in the late 1940s. They point out that the US at that time had no missile expertise whatsoever; the program was set up in Huntsville, Ala., by Wernher von Braun, the German missile genius captured from the defeated Third Reich. A German team constructed the Redstone and Jupiter rockets, but Eisenhower, who distrusted ex-Nazi scientists, eventually grounded von Braun and his German team--until the Soviets launched a basketball-sized satellite called Sputnik. The American public was traumatized by a 1,000- pound satellite zooming across its airspace, and von Braun got the green light to launch a smaller American satellite at once. After summarizing this early history, the authors turn to the later Apollo missions, which they cover in detail (Slayton was one of the program's masterminds), as well as the eventual Soyuz-Apollo mission, a Soviet-US cooperative effort. Interesting historical material is related in a hard-boiled style, complete with dramatic re-enactments, as if the writing committee--counting the folks who worked on the companion Turner Broadcasting documentary scheduled for fall, there are at least four authors--had decided they needed swashbuckling prose to enliven the material. Do we really need to be told that the countdown seconds to a missile launch ``fell like withered leaves''? Still, when its corny style doesn't get the better of it, Moon Shot has its moments, and it's quite readable and detailed.

How to grow your own food in the Southwest!<BR><BR>There is nothing more regionally specific than vegetable gardening--what to plant, when to plant it, and when to harvest are decisions based on climate, weather, and first frost. The Timber Press Guide to Vegetable Gardening in the Southwest, by regional expert Trisha Shirey, focuses on the unique eccentricities of the Southwest gardening calendar, which include extreme temperatures and low rainfall. The month-by-month format makes it perfect for beginners-- gardeners can start gardening the month they pick it up.<BR><BR>This must-have book is for home gardeners in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, eastern California, and southern Colorado.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR>Sweet, vine-ripened watermelon and cantaloupe, succulent eggplant, crisp winter salads, and vibrant bell peppers are just a few of the delights awaiting gardeners in the Southwest. While the cold winters and hot, dry summers can present gardeners with a challenge, there are many ways to have a productive garden and an ever-changing menu of seasonal food.<BR><BR>How do you use the summer heat to grow the most delicious tomatoes? Which months are the best for sowing carrot or beet seeds? How can you make the most of your bountiful harvest during the winter months? Trisha Shirey answers all these questions and more.<BR><BR>Monthly planning guides show exactly what you can do in the garden from January through December, and you'll learn skills that go beyond the basics with tutorials on catching rainwater, making weed teas, and building cold frames. Also included are a comprehensive gardening primer and an A to Z of edibles--a detailed, invaluable source for the region's tried-and-tested varieties. <BR>Whether you are just starting your season or looking for ways to extend it, this is your guide to producing a bountiful, year-round harvest in the Southwest.<BR><BR>About the Author<BR><BR>Trisha Shirey spent over 35 years as a commercial landscape gardener in Austin, Texas. She was the head gardener at the Chancellor of the University of Texas System's residence, the Bauer House. Later she spent 33 years as the director of flora and fauna at Lake Austin Spa Resort in Austin, TX, and was the designer of their award-winning organic herb and vegetable gardens and organic orchard. She was featured on the KLRU-TV program Central Texas Gardener, and is an active speaker on organic gardening, native plants, wildflowers, xeriscaping, and natural pest control. Now retired, Trisha is starting a new garden project on a large property that is a blank canvas. Deep, sandy, loam soil with lots of sun and no deer, rock squirrels, or root knot nematodes are a recipe for a future garden paradise. <BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>Preface<BR>Some of my earliest and fondest memories are from time spent helping out in our family garden when I was young. My mother would can, pickle, and freeze our harvests and we would eat from the garden throughout the year. Our pantry shelves were lined with colorful jars of pickled beets and peaches, green beans, and tomatoes. My mother cooked three meals a day for our family of eight, and every meal was made from scratch--no frozen dinners or take-out--and most of the ingredients came from the garden. My siblings and I were very involved with the preparation and cleanup with every meal. As I grew up, the idea of growing and cooking my own food was never daunting--my parents did it, their parents did it before them, and so on.<BR><BR>When asked why I bother with keeping a garden, I usually think of Weezer from the wonderful Steel Magnolias (beautifully played by Shirley MacLaine). She grew tomatoes and forced them on her friends because she didn't much like them herself. When they asked her why, she replied, "Because I'm an old southern woman and we're supposed to wear funny looking hats and ugly clothes and grow vegetables in the dirt. I don't know why! I don't make the rules." Funny hats? Check. Ugly clothes? Check. Like Weezer, it just seems like I am supposed to do this. Fortunately, I like tomatoes and certainly don't have any friends that would turn down my surplus bounty.<BR><BR>You don't always have to find your dinner at the grocery store; you can pick from whatever is ready for harvesting in your garden. What's more, you won't have to ask any questions about whether it's organic or nutritious and flavorful--you'll have nurtured the plant from it's beginnings as a tiny seed or transplant. You control the conditions. My garden has even turned me into a more adventurous cook--when you're eating kale three or more days of the week, you'll want to have more than a few recipes to rely on.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, many Americans have missed out on the experience of growing up with a food garden. Something that seems so natural to me is still mysterious and complex to so many of my friends. They're often intrigued and excited by the idea of growing their own food, but don't know where to begin. Still, from First Lady Michelle Obama's organic garden at the White House to the exploding trend of food-filled back yards and patios across the nation, more people than ever are now getting into gardening. Seed companies and garden centers are reporting that sales of herb and vegetable seeds and plants are increasing every year.<BR><BR>What could be fresher than produce picked right before it goes on your table? Nutrients and flavor are not lost during transportation and your food hasn't been shipped across the country, contributing to pollution and global warming. You'll learn to appreciate the variety of food that's available each season. I might not have fresh tomatoes in late winter or lettuce in midsummer, but there are so many wonderful seasonal alternatives. You can say goodbye to those transported out-of-season offerings that you find at the grocery store. You can also stop worrying about food contamination, as you'll know exactly what you used on your own garden. Growing crops organically in healthy soil can result in produce with higher levels of vitamin C, iron, phosphorus, antioxidants, and other nutrients. A study by the University of Florida and Washington State found that organic foods contain, on average, about 25 percent higher levels of 11 nutrients than their traditional counterparts. And your investment will go so much further--you can cut your food bills and eat healthier. The National Gardening Association found that a family that invested $70 in a garden could harvest about $600 worth of vegetables.<BR><BR>You'll find that there are physical rewards of gardening also. Vigorous garden work can help to increase bone density and reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. Exercising the mind and body with the planning and care of a garden can reduce stress and the risk of dementia. Studies have shown that gardeners have reduced levels of blood sugar and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Many gardeners find weeding, pruning, watering, and other gardening chores meditative and a great way to unwind from a hectic day. There is pleasure to be taken in watching things grow; you'll develop a connection to natural cycles and feel more self-reliant and empowered. Your children will learn that vegetables don't always have to come from a bag in the freezer and they might be more likely to eat them when they have helped to grow and harvest them. You just might instill a love of gardening that will last a lifetime!<BR><BR>As long as you have at least six hours of sunlight, good air circulation, and access to water, you can grow a great variety of herbs and vegetables in a garden bed or containers. Even in shady locations, parsley, chives, mint, and lettuce can thrive. And a yard isn't always necessary; determined renters and apartment dwellers can always find space to grow their favorite edibles, whether in containers or in community gardens. Sure there will be a few failures along the way, but that's how we learn. I still plant tomatoes that fail to produce a single fruit as a result of unseasonably warm spring temperatures or green beans that succumb to powdery mildew or cucumbers that won't bloom. It happens to all of us--gardening is a gamble. But at least we can compost our failures to build healthy soil for the next season!<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission.

The magnificent conclusion to one of the greatest science fiction sagas of our time<BR><BR>The time of reckoning has arrived. As a final genocidal Crusade threatens to enslave humanity forever, a new messiah has come of age. She is Aenea and she has undergone a strange apprenticeship to those known as the Others.

Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>I've known and admired Professor Edward Sri for many years. He's an exceptional scholar with a great gift for sharing his clarity of thought and commitment of heart with others. Dr. Sri's best-selling study program, A Biblical Walk Through the Mass, has been a blessing for thousands over the past decade. I'm delighted to add my own enthusiastic endorsement to the book as Ascension is publishing a tenth anniversary edition of Dr. Sri's work. COVID-19 separated many of us from Mass for far too long. A good way to re-engage is to read this book together as a family or in small groups. We need to recommit ourselves to the central act of our faith with passion and joy. This marvelously written aid will help us join ourselves to the Lord as he offers himself to the Father in the Sacrifice of the Mass. --Most Reverend Charles J. Chaput, OFM Cap., archbishop emeritus of Philadelphia<BR><BR>I heartily recommend the revised edition of A Biblical Walk Through the Mass by Edward Sri. In this simple yet profound Bible study, Sri unveils the rich biblical roots of the Liturgy. Line by line, he explains the significance of every word and gesture of the Mass that may be so familiar to Catholics yet so poorly understood. If this beautiful program is widely used in parishes, it will go a long way toward rekindling "Eucharistic amazement." --Mary Healy, general editor, Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture<BR><BR>As Dr. Sri observes, many people who have sat through a Mass intuitively know that something deep is happening. They're right, and with A Biblical Walk Through the Mass, they'll have the Scriptural lens through which to see this. Dr. Sri's book is a rich and fascinating exposition of the Mass, where God Himself enters our world to join us in a most intimate of communions! --Curtis Martin, founder of FOCUS, the Fellowship of Catholic University Students<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Dr. Edward Sri is a founding leader with Curtis Martin of FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students). He is author and presenter of A Biblical Walk Through the Mass and Mary: A Biblical Walk with the Blessed Mother. He holds a doctorate from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.

For the first time in a deluxe hardcover edition, three eerily powerful novels by a midcentury master of social satire and psychological portraiture<BR><BR>Jean Stafford (1915-1979) made a bold entrance onto the American literary scene in 1944 when her first novel, Boston Adventure became a surprise best seller. She followed up this initial success with two more acclaimed novels, The Mountain Lion (1944) and The Catherine Wheel (1952), and became a prolific writer of short stories for The New Yorker and other prominent magazines. (Her Collected Stories won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1970.) In later years serious health problems made it increasingly difficult for her to write, and after her death she became a somewhat overlooked figure in 20th-century American literature. Complete Novels allows readers to rediscover "a figure of genuine consequence in American literature" (Jonathan Yardley, Washington Post) at the height of her powers.<BR><BR>Boston Adventure follows Sonia Marburg, the daughter of immigrant parents, as she seeks to escape her impoverished childhood by becoming the secretary-companion of the socially prominent Lucy Pride. The novel won praise for its perceptive satire of upper-class Boston society, while Stafford's portrayal of the inner life of her protagonist drew comparisons to Henry James and Marcel Proust. In The Mountain Lion Stafford drew on her childhood memories of southern California and Colorado to tell the story of Molly Fawcett, her brother Ralph, and their shared journey through the treacherous passage from childhood into adolescence. Set in a country house in Maine, The Catherine Wheel traces the tragic relationship between a lonely boy and his beloved aunt during a summer in which each of them secretly seeks revenge against the people who have betrayed them.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"A revelation. . . . Boston Adventure is surely one of the most haunting depictions of female isolation in fiction, rivaling in its unrelenting sense of imprisonment Charlotte Brontë's Villette. . . . [The Catherine Wheel] vividly evokes the despair of an adolescent engulfed by loneliness. . . . The Mountain Lion is rightly hailed as Stafford's greatest novel, . . . a grim fable, of sorts, about the pressure to leave certain childish things and people behind in order to achieve adulthood." -Maureen Corrigan, The Wall Street Journal<BR><BR>"There is a new opportunity to ask why work of such originality could ever be forgotten ... Forty years after her death, her sentences still gleam like knives." --Parul Sehgal, The New York Times<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Jean Stafford (1915-1979) grew up in southern California and Colorado. After graduating from the University of Colorado in 1936, she studied in Heidelberg for a year, then moved to the Northeast and began to write. Stafford would publish three novels, Boston Adventure (1944), The Mountain Lion (1947), The Catherine Wheel (1952), more than forty short stories (The Collected Stories of Jean Stafford won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1970), and A Mother in History (1966), a journalistic portrait of Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald.<BR><BR>Kathryn Davis is the Hurst Writer in Residence at Washington University and the author of eight novels, including Labrador, The Walking Tour, Duplex, and The Silk Road. She has received the Katherine Anne Porter Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Lannan Literary Award for Fiction.

"Extraordinary. . . . It is a tribute to Starkey's narrative drive, his puckish wit, and sharp discrimination that it doesn't seem a page too long. . . . With each queen, Starkey offers a vivid character study but also has fresh discoveries that subtly alter the picture he started out with." - Sunday Times (London)<BR><BR>The dramatic, legendary story of Henry VIII, his six wives, and the England they ruled-told by one of the world's preeminent historians of the Tudor era.<BR><BR>Perhaps no one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were tumultuous and complicated, and made instant legends of six very different women. Henry took his first bride, Catherine of Aragon, when he was 17. Their 24-year marriage was a relatively stable prelude to what followed. Anne Boleyn, a pretty, French-educated Protestant who was the mother of Elizabeth I, was eventually beheaded. Jane Seymour served as a demure contrast to the vampish Boleyn, and gave birth to Henry's longed-for son (Edward VI). After a brief marriage to the plain Anne of Cleves, Henry married a flirtatious teenager, Catherine Howard, who would be the second of his brides to lose her head along with the king's favor. Finally, there was Catherine Parr, a shrewd Protestant bluestocking.<BR><BR>In this brilliant new work, one of the world's most respected historians weaves startling new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama and political intrigue that attended Henry's six marriages. With a keen eye for both the personal and the global stage, David Starkey masterfully recaptures the Tudor era-and the wives of Henry VIII-as only he can.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>The author of Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne turns his attention to the matrimonial saga of Henry VIII. Antonia Fraser and Alison Weir covered much the same ground in the early 1990s. While they expressed particular interest in 16th-century women and marriage, Starkey dwells at greater length on political and religious subtleties, and develops an imposing cast of supporting characters. The bulk of the book inevitably deals with Henry's first two wives, Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. Accounts of the remaining queens are fleshed out nicely to suggest their personalities, their place in the family networks and religious currents at court and the overall patterns of the king's infatuations and disillusionments. Mildly railing at historians who have not reached the same conclusions as he, Starkey claims to counter old stereotypes about his main characters, but cheerfully repeats those of other figures and nations, including Catherine of Aragon's "machiavellian" father and "the Spanish talent for turning sadism into spectacle." His tendency to modernize personalities gives Anne Boleyn more autonomy than seems plausible, making her the major formulator of policy in Henry's first divorce. Our understanding of Henry's rejection of Anne of Cleves, however, benefits from modern willingness to examine whether the king's inability to consummate the marriage led to the break. Caught between scholarly work and storytelling, the book gives us high drama at a languid pace, with overwhelming detail often slowing the narrative. For readers who are not put off, this is a strong, entertaining and occasionally audacious interpretation. An associated PBS series in July may make this book popular. 16 pages of color photos not seen by PW.<BR>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>From a Cambridge historian. <BR>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>*Starred Review* Divorced, beheaded, died; divorced, beheaded, survived: these are the fates of the six wives of England's king Henry VIII, as taught to British schoolchildren in the form of a rhyme. It is a perennially popular story for history buffs: how the great Tudor king sought a male heir and went to such extremes as establishing his own state religion to ensure the success of his marital plans. But Starkey's account is no rehash; his take on Henry's reign, most specifically Great Harry's sequence of consorts--a "turning point in English history second only to the Norman conquest"--is based on heretofore un- or at least under-investigated documentary evidence. He has new things to say about Henry's queens, especially the first and longest in tenure, Catherine of Aragon, daughter of Spain's king Ferdinand and queen Isabella (their divorce began the whole Church of England business), and the last, Catherine Parr, a noblewoman usually relegated to the status of the least politically important of the half-dozen spouses but here elevated to "one of the most substantial." Detail is profuse but luscious; truly, this is history made as fluent and compelling as excellent fiction. Brad Hooper<BR>Copyright © American Library Association. All rights reserved<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Relentlessly scholarly, Starkey's is the best study of Henry's wives ever published. . . . The particular strength of this mammoth book lies in integrating the petty politics of family and personal advancement with the 'high politics' of state. . . . A masterly and persuasive narrative which, despite its prodigious detail, never loses its grip over the story or the reader." - The Evening Standard<BR><BR>"David Starkey reigns supreme over Tudor history." - Amanda Foreman, author of Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire<BR><BR>"Exciting. ... Very acute. ... It is so gripping that one finishes it wishing it were even longer." - Mail on Sunday<BR><BR>"Extraordinary. . . . It is a tribute to Starkey's narrative drive, his puckish wit, and sharp discrimination that it doesn't seem a page too long. . . . With each queen, Starkey offers a vivid character study but also has fresh discoveries that subtly alter the picture he started out with." - Sunday Times (London)<BR><BR>"Acute and imaginative. . . . [Starkey's] communication of subtle points in simple and vivid language is masterly. . . . In writing a book which scholars will need to read, and which huge numbers of people will want to buy, he has brought off the seemingly impossible." - Sunday Telegraph<BR><BR>"Brilliant. . . . Starkey keeps the narrative alive with a combination of sound chronology, peppery opinion, and startling detail. . . . Six Wives provides an intriguing new perspective on this key period in English history." - Daily Telegraph (London)<BR><BR>"Extraordinary. . . .

A rich account of the six long-celebrated women who, for better or worse, shared the throne with the ax-happy Tudor king. . . .A boon to fans of English royal history, full of murder and mayhem, but also of solid analysis of a maddeningly complicated era." - Kirkus Reviews (starred review)<BR><BR>"Between scholarly work and storytelling, the book gives us high drama. . . . A strong, entertaining, and occasionally audiacious interpretation." - Publishers Weekly<BR><BR>"Truly, this is history made as fluent and compelling as excellent fiction." - Booklist (starred review)<BR><BR>"[An] impressive biography. . . . [Starkey's] language is fresh, alive, current. . . . Possibly the greatest strength of Starkey's work is that he remains steadfastly focused on these six women . . . revealing much about them that was previously unknown and unfathomed, but also disproving many of the prominent myths." - Christian Science Monitor<BR><BR>"Solidly researched and delightfully told, this is highly recommended." - Library Journal <BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR><BR>No one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were daring and tumultuous, and made instant legends of six very different women. What could make him marry six times? In this remarkable new study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer, but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he empowered a group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.<BR><BR>Henry took his first bride, Catherine of Aragon, when he was seventeen. They lasted twenty-four years together, but Catherine suffered through many miscarriages and failed to produce a male heir. Henry then fell in love with Anne Boleyn, the mother of Elizabeth I. Their relationship transformed England forever, but Henry had Anne beheaded and married his next wife, Jane Seymour, on the very day of Anne's execution. At last, Seymour gave birth to Henry's longed-for son, Edward VI. What followed was a farcical beauty contest which ended in the King's brief marriage to the "mare of Flanders," Anne of Cleves. Finally, there were the two Catherines: Catherine Howard, the flirtatious teenager whose adulteries made a fool of the aging king and who was the second bride to lose her head; and Catherine Parr, the shrewd, religiously radical bluestocking who outlived him.<BR><BR>Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy.

Do you want to double or triple the speed with which you calculate? How to Calculate Quickly is a tried and true method for helping you in the mathematics of daily life - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and fractions. <BR>The author can awaken for you a faculty which is surprisingly dormant in accountants, engineers, scientists, businesspeople, and others who work with figures. This is "number sense" - or the ability to recognize relations between numbers considered as whole quantities. Lack of this number sense makes it entirely possible for a scientist to be proficient in higher mathematics, but to bog down in the arithmetic of everyday life. <BR>This book teaches the necessary mathematical techniques that schools neglect to teach: Horizontal addition, left to right multiplication and division, etc. You will learn a method of multiplication so rapid that you'll be able to do products in not much more time than it would take to write the problem down on paper. <BR>This is not a collection of tricks that work in only a very few special cases, but a serious, capably planned course of basic mathematics for self-instruction. It contains over 9,000 short problems and their solutions for you to work during spare moments. Five or ten minutes spent daily on this book will, within ten weeks, give you a number sense that will double or triple your calculation speed.

Three ordinary women are about to take one extraordinary step.<BR><BR>Twenty-two-year-old Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from Ole Miss. She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.<BR><BR>Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.<BR><BR>Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.<BR><BR>Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.<BR><BR>In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women--mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends--view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. <BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>Praise for The Help<BR><BR>"This could be one of the most important pieces of fiction since To Kill a Mockingbird...If you read only one book...let this be it."--NPR.org<BR><BR>"Wise, poignant...You'll catch yourself cheering out loud."--People<BR><BR>"Graceful and real, a compulsively readable story."--Entertainment Weekly<BR><BR>"A beautiful portrait of a fragmenting world."--The Atlanta Journal-Constitution<BR><BR>"The must-read choice of every book club in the country."--The Huffington Post

All rights reserved.<BR>From Chapter 3: The Water Supply Water Sources - Water Supply Systems, Wells, Pumps, Natural Springs, Ponds, Water Distribution<BR>Water Quality<BR>We started our publishing business in a converted motorcycle repair shop in Pownal, Vermont. One hot July morning, we ran out of water.<BR>We called Floyd Patterson, the builder, who explained that there was a reservoir in the hills and a pipeline that ran down a mile or so. "Could be a break anywhere on the line," he said. "We could dig it all up, but why don't we try a dowser first?" Skeptically, we watched the dowser use a forked stick made of hazel. Within 20 minutes he had found the break, allowing the backhoe to dig in just the right spot. We were quickly becoming converts to the arts, crafts, and skills of country life.<BR>--John & Martha Storey<BR>Good homesteading land must have an unfailing supply of good water. As you look at land, find out all you can about the amount and quality that is available. An ideal site will have a reliable spring, but if yours does not, it may have a well. As a last resort, you may have to develop a new well.<BR>Spring. If you have a spring, be sure it has an ample flow of 4 to 6 gallons a minute. Does it flow year-round or dry up during summer? Is it reasonably near your home site? If the answer to these questions is "yes," you probably have a reliable water supply. But you'll need to have the water tested for purity and hardness, too.<BR>Well. Dug wells are seen on old farms that were in operation before electricity became common. They were dug with hand tools, and the sides were rocked or bricked up to prevent cave-ins. Drilled wells are common today, primarily because of the availability of drilling equipment. To create a driven well, a pipe fitted with a well point is driven into water-bearing sand.<BR>Town water. Many rural areas have established water districts. If you live close enough to the town water line, you may have a choice of whether to dig a well or tap into town water. Figure the cost of both options over 10 or 20 years before deciding. Check with local officials, because sometimes you pay for town water anyway.<BR>Non-drinking water. There are time-honored methods of gathering water for animals and for washing. One is the creation of the farm pond, usually the excavation of a low-lying, swampy area. Normal drainage should fill the pond to a consistent depth. Another method is catching rainwater from eave troughs in barrels. Some homesteaders in low-water areas provide most or all of their water needs from rainwater, which is naturally soft, by constructing home roof runoff systems that filter into very large storage cisterns.<BR>Water Supply Systems<BR>Five Kinds of Wells<BR>Because groundwater moves in so many ways, at different speeds and different depths, the general term well is about as useful as the word aircraft. To say a well is any pit or hole in the ground used to extract water is a misleading oversimplification. Some shallow wells venture only a short distance from the ground surface. Elsewhere, wells penetrate deep into subterranean space.<BR>Like groundwater, wells and well technology are complex and largely misunderstood by the public. Understanding begins with knowledge of the basic kinds of wells.<BR>Dug Wells<BR>Grandma's "wishing well," with its stone-wall top we could just see over, its little roof, and the bucket on a windlass, was almost certainly a dug well. Because it penetrated just a short distance into the water table, its water may have been polluted even in our grandparents' time. A very high percentage of today's dug wells are contaminated.<BR>Dug wells are generally thought to be undependable as well as unclean. They're often known to fail during dry times. Still, in places where the water table remains pretty constant and groundwater quality is high, dug wells are common. They're rarely more than 50 feet deep, reaching just a few feet below the water table into soaked sand and gravel.<BR>Digging the well hole, which may range from 3 to 20 feet in diameter, is normally a tedious, hand-excavated, pick-and-shovel operation.<BR>Dug-out material is hauled to the surface in a pail on a rope. A clam-shell bucket on a crane can be used if the earth is very soft. Digging a well can be very dangerous because of the potential for cave-in. Seek professional advice on constructing a structure within which to dig the well.<BR>The stone wall around the top of Grandma's well was actually the upper end of the lining. Today, fieldstone is used to keep the well walls from caving in, but brick and mortar or concrete blocks are easier to work with. More often, dug wells are cased with sections of 3-foot-wide, precase well tile that fit together at tongue-and-groove joints. Whatever the material, the lining should be as well sealed and watertight as possible.<BR>A modern dug well should have a sanitary seal at the ground surface, which effectively keeps rainwater out of water below. It will keep surface water from contaminating the water table. Space between the well liner and the surrounding earth should be plugged with a waterproof cement grout.<BR>Bored Wells<BR>A bored well is essentially a dug well made with an earth auger instead of a shovel. If the auger is turned by hand, the hole will be between 8 and 14 inches in diameter. Power-driven augers bore wider holes-up to 3 feet in diameter. A bored well might be somewhat deeper than an<BR>ordinary dug well, but rarely can it be expected to reach a water table lower than 100 feet in the ground.<BR>Vitrified tile, steel, and plastic are the lining materials used most often. In some instances this casing is perforated where the pipe extends into water-bearing gravel and sand. These perforations receive water from the surrounding strata, and may need to be covered with screening to keep silt from entering the discharge line. Like all wells, a bored well head must be sealed and protected from surface drainage.<BR>Jetted or Washed Wells<BR>If conditions are right, a well can be jetted or washed. The two most important ingredients in this kind of operation-aside from soil with reasonably uniform texture-are a nearby water source and a pressure pump. A protective casing is driven into an augered hole and a riser pipe, fitted with a special washing point on its lower end, is inserted inside the casing. A stream of water is forced down this riser pipe and the jet from the wash point dislodges sand and soil below. As the point is pushed deeper and deeper, the muddy mixture is carried back to the surface in the space between the center pipe and the casing, and is discharged into a settling vat. Later, when the wash point is removed, the riser pipe becomes the suction line for water being pumped out of the well from above, and the top few feet of space between the two pipes are grouted to make it watertight.<BR>Driven Wells<BR>A driven well is quick, relatively inexpensive, and, unless there's an unlimited water supply near the surface, relatively undependable compared to the drilled well. In places where well driving is easy but the water table fluctuates, homeowners hedge their bets by driving a number of wells and connecting them to one pump.<BR>Driven wells can be 25 to 100 feet deep, though most draw water from 50 to 60 feet. A well point or sand point, made of cast steel, is connected to lengths of threaded pipe and forced into the ground by blows on the pipe from above. This is the simplest and most direct way to reach groundwater, as long as there are no rocks in the soil to damage the wire mesh jacket of the well point.<BR>The well point itself is only 1 1/4 to 2 inches in diameter, so it has little resistance as it penetrates. The necessarily small riser pipe limits a driven well's yield to about 3 gallons a minute.<BR>Drilled Wells<BR>Maybe the best argument for a deep (and probably more expensive) drilled well is that it's less likely to be polluted. Second, it's more likely to produce greater yield, simply because of its immense draw-down potential.<BR>In many districts, law demands that wells be drilled only by licensed drillers. There may be other regulations about well location, construction, capacity, disinfection methods, and water-quality standards. A drilling permit may or may not be needed. Rules vary from place to place. So do the per-foot drilling and casing costs.<BR>Drilled wells are done in one of two ways: with a percussion-type cable tool that beats and punches its way into the ground, or with a rotary bit that grinds, bites, and crushes its way through rock. Both are mounted on portable derricks with self-contained hoists.<BR>Rock cuttings are mixed with water trucked to the job site, and the resulting slurry is lifted to the surface in a bailer, a 10- to 20-foot length of pipe with a valve at its lower end. Bailing gives the drillers an indication of the formations the drill is breaking through.<BR>Pumps<BR>As everybody knows, pumps are machines for elevating water. Keep in mind that "pump" refers to both the water-moving mechanism and the power source that operates it-be it a windmill, motor, or the muscles in the arm that operate a hand pump. Remember, too, that pumps come in a variety of sizes and types. Proper selection and sizing are vital, and the range of choices is wide. It's worth spending the time to know a little about each.<BR>Reciprocating (Piston) Pump<BR>A reciprocating pump is a positive-displacement pump. It consists of a mechanical device that moves a plunger back and forth in a closely fitted cylinder. The plunger is driven by the power source, and the power motion is converted from a rotating action to a reciprocating motion by the combined work of a speed reducer, crank, and connecting rod. The cylinder should be located near or below the static water level to eliminate the need for priming. The pumping action begins when the water enters the cylinder through a check valve. When the piston moves, the check valve closes, forcing the water through a check valve in the plunger. With each subsequent stroke, the water is forced toward the surface through the discharge pipe.<BR>Centrifugal Pump<BR>If a child's hollow top had holes drilled around its greatest circumference, was filled with water to the height of these holes, and then was spun, it would shoot out water in all directions. As the top turned faster, water would be thrown farther and with more force, in proportion to the speed increase. Imagine that the top also had a hole in its base and could be spun as it sat in a pan of water. As water shot from the upper holes, an equal amount would be sucked into the bottom. A centrifugal pump works much the same way.<BR>Within every centrifugal pump is at least one rotating impeller, which spins water outward across its curved vanes at ever-increasing speed.<BR>The water is accelerated enough to create a partial vacuum, causing more water to be drawn into the eye of the impeller. The impeller itself sits in a precisely machined wearing ring, which allows it to turn independent of the suction pipe.<BR>A centrifugal pump does not displace a constant quantity of water. Increases in water pressure will slow it down, and it will pump less water as the water level in a well diminishes. A shallow-well centrifugal pump can't be called upon to lift water more than 15 to 20 feet. The centrifugal jet is the most common pump for domestic water systems. It requires little maintenance, is quiet, and because of its simple design, it's economical to own and operate.<BR>Jet (Ejector) Pump<BR>When water under pressure is jetting through a small opening like a garden hose nozzle, it accelerates and squirts. As it speeds up, a low-pressure zone is created at the very spot where the squirt begins. Any fluid near the squirt tends to get drawn into the jet stream. This additional fluid contributes to the overall flow. It's easy to see that a jet of water, blown into other water, could move a large volume of liquid.<BR>If this happens in a confined space, such as a well pipe, all of the original water plus the extra can be slowed down again in a gradually widening venturi called a diffuser. Low-pressure water, diffused of its velocity, develops strong force that can be carried forward. In other words, high-speed water blown into the point of a hollow cone will slow down and be converted into pressure.<BR>An ejector is a metal plumbing assembly that contains just such a nozzle and a diffuser. The combination of an ejector and a centrifugal pump-called a centrifugal jet pump-is a powerful one.<BR>Submersible Pump<BR>When a centrifugal pump is driven by a closely coupled electric motor constructed for submerged operation as a single unit, it is called a submersible pump. Today's units are slender enough to pass down a 6-inch, 4-inch, or even a 2-inch well casing, and are dependable enough to stay there for years without major servicing.<BR>A typical submersible pump is operated by a 1/2-horsepower electric motor and has as many as 14 teams of impellers and diffusers, one above the other. It's suspended on a drop line attached to the well seal above. The pump's motor is filled with lubricating oil, but depends on the water that surrounds it for cooling.<BR>Troubleshooting and servicing are usually easy and uncomplicated. The biggest danger to the pump is motor burnout, which can happen if the water level in the well gets too low or when the intake screen becomes clogged.<BR>--adapted from The Home Water Supply by Stu Campbell and Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency<BR>Selecting a Pump<BR>You've studied the basic operation of each type of pump. Now you're approaching another moment of truth-the selection of your pump. It's important to coordinate this with your well driller. You'll need to map out the yield of your water source, weigh it against your daily needs, and figure the total head and lift in your proposed system. A plumbing contractor or pump dealer can help you accomplish this.<BR>If the lift from your source to the pressure tank is never greater than 15 to 25 feet-even when the well is at its lowest-a shallow-well pump offers the best bargain. All you do is drop a suction line down the well.<BR>Don't forget that a shallow-well pump should have either a foot valve at the base of the suction line or a check valve in the suction line to keep it filled. This way the pump will always keep its prime. Obviously, a nonsubmersible pump should never freeze. So it must be sheltered in a warm, dry place where you can get at it easily.<BR>If the lift is more than 25 feet, you'll have to explore the many deep-well pump possibilities. The size of the well casing will influence your decision, particularly if it's smaller than 4 inches in diameter. There are a number of deep-well piston pumps for casings as small as 2 inches. Jet pumps for 2-inch casings are also available.<BR>Before you sign on the dotted line, get advice from plumbing contractors and several reputable dealers. Ask questions about reliability, initial cost, economy, efficiency, servicing, and availability of replacement parts. There's no reason for a good supplier to offer bad advice. A dealer who sells you the wrong product knows he or she is only going to end up with service and warranty problems later on.<BR>--from The Home Water Supply by Stu Campbell<BR>Natural Resources<BR>Springs as Water Sources<BR>Not all springs are enchantingly clean or beautiful. There's one behind my house that I didn't know about until the house was finished. I can depend on it only to erupt each November, do its best to flood my driveway all winter, then shut off automatically around May 15.<BR>A spring is any opening where water flows out of the earth, either by gravity or artesian pressure. Unfortunately, many of these wounds in the earth's skin "bleed" erratically, and the irregularities are so dramatic that a spring may not always be considered a reliable water source. They are also easily contaminated, especially in places where there is a lot of contact water.<BR>Tapping in. It pays to watch a spring for at least a year before you make up your mind to tap it. Observe the spring closely during dry spells.<BR>To be considered truly dependable, it should yield at least twice a family's maximum needs, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.<BR>A spring on a hillside will provide water pressure to a home below. In fact, for every 2 feet of elevation, 1 pound of pressure will be developed. The pressure will always be there as long as the spring is productive enough to keep the intake pipe filled. The spring functions like an elevated reservoir.<BR>If the spring's yield is inconsistent, a hydropneumatic system made up of a storage tank, pump, and pressure tank will be needed to pressurize the home's internal plumbing.<BR>If the spring is located below the house, it's a whole different story. You will have to determine the distance water must be lifted and calculate head loss before designing a pump system that's sure to be adequate.<BR>A developed spring will have at least five components: the spring box, a basin that's watertight above, yet open enough below grade to let groundwater flow into it freely; a cover or housing; cleanout access; an overflow; and an intake line that connects to the distribution system of the house.<BR>Protection. Protecting the sanitary quality of any spring used as a potable water source is of paramount importance. A spring ought to have a removable cover, but the cover should be a heavy one and perhaps be locked in place. I've never known a child who could resist exploring a spring once he or she has found one. It's best to fence in a spring, to keep out both children and livestock.<BR>Terrain above a spring should be bermed or swaled to divert surface drainage. If springwater looks turbid after a heavy rainstorm, runoff water is probably getting into the spring.<BR>A contaminated spring should be disinfected, much like a well or cistern. A solution of water and bleach may be poured into the spring box.<BR>It should be allowed to run through the spring line to the house until its chlorine odor can be smelled at all fixtures. Disinfectant should sit in the system for as long as 24 hours if possible. Then it can be flushed out.<BR>--from The Home Water Supply by Stu Campbell<BR>Ponds<BR>Building an Excavated Pond<BR>New ponds come in two categories: the excavated pond and the embankment pond. Excavated ponds are simpler and more economical to build on nearly level land. They eliminate the need for expensive and elaborate embankments, spillways, and drainage systems. Their<BR>maintenance cost is low, and they are relatively safe from floodwater damages. Their disadvantages may lie in limits on the size of the area that can be excavated.<BR>Selecting the correct site is the most important part of any plan, and the water-holding capacity of the soil is especially critical. Test borings to the proposed depth of the pond, then filling the hole with water, will give some idea of the water-holding capacity of the lower soil strata.<BR>If there is some doubt that the test reflects the bottom strata, set a pipe the full depth of the hole, then fill the pipe with water. The result will reflect the water-holding capacity at your maximum proposed depth.<BR>Excavated ponds may be fed by surface runoffs, groundwater aquifers, underground water from natural springs, or water pumped from man-made wells. If you have a good water table, the water-holding qualities of the soil at the pond site will not be a problem; if your water table is too low, include a supplementary water supply in your plans.<BR>Bentonite is a volcanic clay that makes an excellent sealing compound. It is applied by mixing about 2 pounds per square foot of land surface, disking it into the top 6 inches of soil, then packing it tightly.<BR>Rectangular ponds are the most popular, because they are simpler to build and can be adapted to most kinds of excavating equipment. The width will be dictated by the size of the equipment available; the length, by the square feet of water surface desired.<BR>Some authorities recommend hauling away the excavated material. This is expensive. Instead, the excavated soil can be used to build embankments around the excavated area to raise the pond's water level.<BR>Building an Embankment Pond<BR>Embankment ponds are the most expensive and difficult to build. You will no doubt need an engineer or expert technical advice and assistance in both the planning and the construction phases.<BR>The elevation of dams and spillways must be calculated precisely. The exact degrees of slope in the pond and the spillway must also be determined. Other important factors include the nature of the soil at the depth of excavation; the suitability of material for building the dam; and determining the best sealing agent for the particular conditions. A poorly planned or constructed embankment pond will be not only a sore disappointment, but also a waste of money.<BR>Heavy equipment is needed to construct embankment ponds. The equipment may include a dragline excavator, bulldozer, tractor-pulled wheeled scraper, sheepsfoot roller, and a compaction roller. Renting this type of equipment can be expensive; hiring the operators adds to the cost.<BR>Before making even initial plans for an embankment pond, contact the people at the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. They provide many free services in the planning and construction phases.<BR>Embankment ponds are usually built in valleys at the foot of a watershed, or at the foot of a small stream. Care must be taken about interrupting normal waterflows that affect other farms in the area. Check with your county and state authorities before altering streams, regardless of how small.<BR>A solution might be to build your pond on the edge of a stream, then pump the water into the pond. However, such stream waters may be rife with trash fish that you will not want in your pond. To remove the wild fish and fish eggs from the stream water, you may have to pass the water through a screen filter.<BR>Water Distribution<BR>Planning Your System<BR>Water distribution systems turn out best when they're thoughtfully planned, diagrammed, and tailored to circumstances rather than bound by traditions.<BR>Long-term considerations for any plumbing machine (it is just that) must see beyond initial costs. Convenience and adequate supply to all corners of the system are not the least of your worries. Nor is energy use. Maintenance costs are another large factor. And noise in your system can become a big annoyance. Plumbing within the house itself may be part of your home's building plan. Outside sillcocks and hydrants are another story, and here you'll need to do your most careful thinking.<BR>Start drafting your plan by making a sketch of your property, including all buildings and outbuildings. If you draw it to scale, the whole project will become that much easier to understand and estimate. Include in the drawing any known obstacles that would make a straight trench (between house and chicken coop, for instance) difficult.<BR>Now you need to figure the demand at each outlet. Not only will you need to estimate a peak demand allowance for each building, but you should also determine which outlet will have the greatest fixture flow rate.<BR>Draw a line from the source, such as the well, to the point of largest demand-probably the house. Draw a second line to the next closest major demand, and others to all locations. Pipes should be laid as straight as possible in trenches dug below the frost line, but there may be situations where a straight line is the shortest but not the easiest distance between two points.<BR>Plan for cutoff valves throughout the system. Locate them so that when one part of the system needs to be shut down for repair, service everywhere else isn't interrupted.<BR>Take your time figuring out what you want and need. Once you have your completed drawing, take it to a good plumber. It's worth investigating which plumbing contractor can do the best installation at the best price, as well as which will provide the best service.<BR>--from The Home Water Supply by Stu Campbell<BR>Water Reserves<BR>Water reserves are an integral part of any water supply system for a home or farm. Water to be stored for later use can be collected in three primary ways.<BR>Cisterns are ground-level or below-ground reservoirs. A cistern that collects and stores rainwater can be expected to gather as much as 2/3 to 3/4 of the annual rainfall on the catchment. Some homes have cisterns just for emergency storage, but others use rainwater for garden water, cleaning, toilet flushing, and other nonpotable uses. Because rainwater is soft, water in a cistern can also be used for bathing, laundry, and dishwashing.<BR>Constructing a good cistern is not a project to be taken lightly. Brick or stone masonry is sometimes used, but high-density concrete, vibrated as it's cast in place, is far better. The concrete should be allowed to wet-cure before the cistern is used.<BR>Cisterns should be carefully covered, and their sidewalls should stick out of the ground at least 18 inches. Covers must be accessible, of course, but they should be locked to keep unwanted visitors and substances from getting in. Manhole covers make great cistern covers.<BR>Cisterns should be disinfected with a chlorine solution on a regular basis.<BR>Elevated storage tanks, called gravity tanks, provide gravity-flow pressure to systems below. They're usually designed to hold enough to supply a family with at least two days' worth of water. Gravity tanks should have vents to allow air in as the water level within them is lowered, and to let air out as water is pumped in. Screening should cover these vents to keep out insects and small animals.<BR>A gravity tank can provide pressure to a system without any need for a pressure tank if it's located high above the uppermost outlets in the house. As always, 2.3 feet of elevation will produce 1 pound of pressure. If the system needs 20 pounds per square inch (psi), the tank must be at least 46 feet above any faucet.<BR>Pressure tanks and elastic storage cells constitute the third type of water storage. Although they generally have a small capacity, hydropneumatic tanks and storage cells are considered the most sanitary way to keep water on hand. Their additional function is to keep a steady push of water against the plumbing.<BR>-from The Home Water Supply by Stu Campbell <BR><BR></div

The first collection of Leibniz's key writings on the binary system, newly translated, with many previously unpublished in any language.<BR><BR>The polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) is known for his independent invention of the calculus in 1675. Another major--although less studied--mathematical contribution by Leibniz is his invention of binary arithmetic, the representational basis for today's digital computing. This book offers the first collection of Leibniz's most important writings on the binary system, all newly translated by the authors with many previously unpublished in any language. Taken together, these thirty-two texts tell the story of binary as Leibniz conceived it, from his first youthful writings on the subject to the mature development and publication of the binary system.<BR><BR>As befits a scholarly edition, Strickland and Lewis have not only returned to Leibniz's original manuscripts in preparing their translations, but also provided full critical apparatus. In addition to extensive annotations, each text is accompanied by a detailed introductory "headnote" that explains the context and content. Additional mathematical commentaries offer readers deep dives into Leibniz's mathematical thinking. The texts are prefaced by a lengthy and detailed introductory essay, in which Strickland and Lewis trace Leibniz's development of binary, place it in its historical context, and chart its posthumous influence, most notably on shaping our own computer age.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"A wonderful book that explains both the significance and scope of Leibniz' binary arithmetic using original sources.

Nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read<BR><BR>"It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery," remarked Alexander Pope when Gulliver's Travels was published in 1726. One of the unique books of world literature, Swift's masterful satire describes the astonishing voyages of one Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, to surreal kingdoms inhabited by miniature people and giants, quack philosophers and scientists, horses endowed with reason and men who behave like beasts. Written with great wit and invention, Gulliver's Travels is a savage parody on man and his institutions that has captivated readers for nearly three centuries. <BR><BR>As bestselling author and critic Allan Bloom observed: "Gulliver's Travels is an amazing rhetorical achievement. Swift had not only the judgment with which to arrive at a reasoned view of the world but the fancy by means of which he could re-create that world in a form which teaches where argument fails and which satisfies all while misleading none."<BR><BR>This representative collection of Swift's major writings includes the complete Gulliver's Travels as well as A Tale of a Tub, "The Battle of the Books," "A Modest Proposal," "An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity," "The Bickerstaff Papers," and many more of his brilliantly satirical works. Here too are selections from Swift's poetry and portions of his Journal to Stella. Swift's savage ridicule, corrosive wit, and sparkling humor are fully displayed in this comprehensive collection.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR>Considered one of English literature's first and greatest satirists, Jonathan Swift possessed a timeless genius for pointing out the foibles of human nature that still has the power to provoke, amuse, and, at times, even outrage <BR>our modern sensibilities. This representative collection of Swift's major writings includes the complete "Gulliver's Travels as well as "A Tale of a Tub, "The Battle of the Books," "A Modest Proposal," "An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity," "The Bickerstaff Papers," and many more of his brilliantly satirical works. Here too are selections from Swift's poetry and portions of his Journal to Stella. Swift's savage ridicule, corrosive wit, and sparkling humor are fully displayed in this comprehensive collection.<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Jonathan Swift was born in 1667, the son of Anglo-Irish parents. After an education in Ireland, Swift moved to England where he reluctantly chose a career in the church. There, he worked for Sir William Temple, in whose household he met Esther Johnson. The two fell in love, but were never publicly married. While in England, Swift discovered his talents as a satirist, producing texts such as "A Tale Of A Tub" and "The Battle of the Books" (1704). At age thirty-one, Swift returned to Ireland as chaplain to a lord justice. Swift maintained his energy and wit and, later in life, wrote "A Modest Proposal" (1729) and GULLIVER'S TRAVELS (1726). Swift died on October 19, 1745.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>A Voyage to Lilliput<BR><BR>Chapter I<BR><BR>The author gives some account of himself and family; his first inducements to travel. He is shipwrecked, and swims for his life, gets safe on shore in the country of Lilliput, is made a prisoner, and carried up the country.<BR><BR>My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I resided three years, and applied my self close to my studies: but the charge of maintaining me (although I had a very scanty allowance) being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years; and my father now and then sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father; where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physics two years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.<BR><BR>Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended, by my good master Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannell commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I came back, I resolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged me; and by him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jury, and being advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmond Burton, hosier, in Newgate Street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.<BR><BR>But, my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I determined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships, and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by which I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language, wherein I had a great facility by the strength of my memory.<BR><BR>The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I removed from the Old Jury to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account. After three years' expectation that things would mend, I accepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South Sea. We set sail from Bristol, May 4th, 1699, and our voyage at first was very prosperous.<BR><BR>It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas: let it suffice to inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen's Land. By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour, and ill food; the rest were in a very weak condition. On the fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock, within half a cable's length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship, and the rock. We rowed by my computation about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent with labour while we were in the ship. We therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves; and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom: but when I was almost gone and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, above nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir: for as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but, in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the mean time, I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill, but distinct voice, Hekinah degul: the others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness: at length, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me; and, at the same time, with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, Tolgo phonac; when in an instant I felt above an hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which pricked me like so many needles; and besides they shot another flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face, which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain, and then striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley larger than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides; but, by good luck, I had on me a buff jerkin, which they could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows: but by the noise increasing, I knew their numbers were greater; and about four yards from me, over-against my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like people at work; when, turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three times, Langro dehul san: (these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me). Whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him who was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him, whereof one was a page who held up his train, and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on each side to support him. He acted every part of an orator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting up my left hand and both eyes to the sun, as calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger frequently on my mouth to signify that I wanted food. The Hurgo (for so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt) understood me very well. He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides, on which above an hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the King's orders upon the first intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs and loins shaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as fast as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most ingenious people, they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it hardly held half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same manner, and made signs for more, but they had none to give me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first, Hekinah degul. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first warned the people below to stand out of the way, crying aloud, Borach mivola; and when they saw the vessels in the air, there was an universal shout of Hekinah degul. I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of honour I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive behaviour, soon drove out those imaginations. Besides, I now considered my self as bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk on my body, while one of my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue. And producing his credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger, but with a kind of determinate resolution; often pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was agreed by his Majesty in council that I must be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number of my enemies encreased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the Hurgo and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words, Peplom selan, and I felt great numbers of the people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water; which I very plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the people, who conjecturing by my motions what I was going to do, immediately opened to the right and left on that side to avoid the torrent which fell with such noise and violence from me. But before this, they had daubed my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the smell, which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows. These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's order, had mingled a sleeping potion in the hogsheads of wine.

Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla (Barnes & Noble Collectible Editions) by Nikola Tesla <BR><BR>The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla is the definitive record of the pioneering work of one of the modern world's most groundbreaking inventors. During the early twentieth century, Tesla blazed the trail that electrical technology followed for decades afterward. Although he pioneered inventions like alternating current (AC), radio, wireless transmission, and X-rays, and worked with innovators like George Westinghouse and Thomas Edison, the once-celebrated Tesla was later largely forgotten by history. This beautiful leatherbound edition brings together many of the findings and theories that made this genius famous (and to some, infamous), showing not only the scope of Nikola Tesla's theories and inventions, but allowing contemporary readers to experience the visionary range of his thinking. In addition to its many detailed reproductions of Tesla's patents and inventions, this highly collectible book includes dozens of thought-provoking lectures and articles. The Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla affords a rare glimpse of a true genius at work.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>Nikola Tesla's Electricity Unplugged is a unique anthology of hand-picked Tesla articles, arranged historically, which presents overwhelming and convincing evidence for the reality of Tesla's high efficiency, low cost wireless power transmission. Following in the footsteps of the editor's first book in the series, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature, Dr. Tom Valone's book chronologically traces the original intention that Nikola Tesla had for his wireless electricity and how he updated and expanded upon it later on, with reprints of his key articles, to the recent genius engineers and physicists who are now finally bringing this last and most elusive, highly advanced Tesla technology into reality. The Corum article (along with the Peterson article) on the Zenneck wave transmission experiments culminates the viewpoints of all of the book's contributors. Its purposeful placement as the last chapter of the book, is because this exclusive article publication is a major scientific breakthrough, as testified by the book's endorsement from Brigadier General Michael Miller, and foretells the understandable, visionary road to the corporate formation of wireless power utilities. Furthermore, this is the first and only book in the world which explains how an electromagnetic wave traveling across the electrically conductive surface of the earth, was predicted by Tesla and Zenneck (two pictures in the book show them together on pages 74 and 381) and why it is the essential missing link of any Tesla wireless transmission theory. Many of the contributors also nicely explain the "surface wave phenomenon" as well as "resonant earth-ionosphere" modes of electrical transmission without wires that compliments the surface wave theory and experiment. Nikola Tesla's Electricity Unplugged therefore is a treasure compared to any other Tesla reference book currently in print, since it is jam-packed with personal stories of Tesla, such as one reprinted from the prestigious Smithsonian magazine, along with great illustrated slideshows adapted for the book format, the "secret" history of Tesla's wireless, the real Tesla electric car, high Q resonant power transfer examples being used today by Qualcomm, "Tesla unplugged" explained in an easy-to-understand presentation by a Brookhaven National Lab scientist, wireless electricity article based on scalar waves, even including a couple amazing rigorous equation articles with wireless solutions for the tech audience, a unique and evocative Foreword by Nikola Tesla's last living direct descendant, all presented in a 457-page paperback book, suitable as a college or high school reader, or simply as an eye-opening, optimistic window onto the electrical genius regarded as the "Master of Lightning," with a priceless collection of nineteen (19) contributors not available anywhere else.<BR><BR>About the Author:<BR><BR>Nikola Tesla (1856 &#x2015; 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.<BR><BR>David Hatcher Childress, known as the real-life Indiana Jones to the many fans of his books, is a captivating speaker and the author or coauthor of over 25 books. He has traveled the world several times over, seeking adventure and the answers to the mysteries of mankind's past. Born in France in 1957 and raised in the mountains of Colorado and Montana, David's curiosity about the world was piqued at a young age. He attended the University of Montana where his studies in oriental culture and philosophy led him to a job teaching English in Taiwan. In 1976, David left the United States on what would become a six-year research and adventure odyssey. During this time, he studied first-hand the ancient civilizations of Africa, the Middle East and China, sometimes journeying into dangerous territory along the way (like Uganda during the overthrow of Idi Amin). After more than 40 years of investigating these arcane subjects, David finds his unique views and ideas gaining popularity. He is currently a co-star on the History Channel show Ancient Aliens. This popular show is now in its eleventh season and David journeys to Peru, Bolivia and Mexico for episodes of the show. He has appeared on Fox-TV's Sightings and Encounters, two NBC-TV specials, The Conspiracy Zone, and segments for the Discovery Channel, A&E, the Sci-Fi Channel, the Disney Channel, The Travel Channel and others. David also appeared on the Canadian television show Weird or What?, hosted by William Shatner, in its 2011-2012 season. He is also a frequent guest on nationally syndicated radio shows. He continues to explore, write and excite people about discovery through his magazine, World Explorer, and his publishing company, Adventures Unlimited Press. When not traveling, he divides his time between his homes in Illinois and Arizona. He has bookstores open to the public in both locations.

This adventurous two-volume collection presents a rich vein of modern American writing too often neglected in mainstream literary histories. Evolving out of the terse and violent hardboiled style of the pulp magazines, noir fiction expanded over the decades into a varied and innovative body of writing. Tapping deep roots in the American literary imagination, the novels in this volume explore themes of crime, guilt, deception, obsessive passion, murder, and the disintegrating psyche. With visionary and often subversive force they create a dark and violent mythology out of the most commonplace elements of modern life. The raw power of their vernacular style has profoundly influenced contemporary American culture and writing.<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>The best American crime novels deserve their place in the pantheon of American literature, but they hold special interest for cinema enthusiasts, who can both compare them to the movies they became and can roll imaginary films of the stories in their minds. Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s is the second of Library of America's two-volume anthology of underground U.S. fiction. The first anthology featured works from the 1930s and '40s that had been made into classic films noir. This volume focuses on fiction written after the crime genre had acquired conventions that younger writers toyed with and sometimes broke. The movies made from such stories were equally radical. <BR><BR>Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley is the source for René Clément's bristling Purple Noon, a movie that features Alain Delon's quintessential performance. David Goodis's Down There inspired François Truffaut's neo-noir masterpiece Shoot the Piano Player. Jim Thompson, the brilliant author who scripted The Killing and Paths of Glory for Stanley Kubrick, wrote several novels that have been turned into movies, including The Grifters and The Getaway. He is represented here by one of his most uncompromising works, The Killer Inside Me, which was filmed by Burt Kennedy in 1976. Charles Willeford's Pick-Up and Chester Himes's The Real Cool Killers have not yet been made into movies, but the blistering prose and nihilistic worlds of these authors, and of all the writers represented in this volume, is astonishingly cinematic. This lovely hardcover edition contains biographical, textual, and explanatory notes. <BR><BR>From Library Journal<BR>The Library of America gave a tremendous boost to the reputation of hard-boiled detective fiction with the inclusion of Raymond Chandler among its illustrious ranks (Classic Returns, LJ 9/15/95). This new two-volume set is another giant step in the direction of legitimacy for the pulp mystery genre. This duo collect 11 of the best crime novels in which the criminal rather than the sleuth is the central character. Included here are such gems as James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, Cornell Woolrich's I Married a Dead Man, Jim Thompson's The Killer Inside Me, Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Chester Himes's The Real Cool Killers.

These tales of murder and mayhem belong in all fiction collections.<BR>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>Review<BR>These novels, nearly 2,000 pages in length, beautifully bound and arranged--often following rare first-edition design blueprints--contain some of the best crime writing of the genre's golden decades. They should give much pleasure to lovers of film noir and readers addicted to original and eclectic writing. And for cineastes, Pick-up and The Real Cool Killers, alone among these novels, have yet to be made into films noir. So you'll have to read the books first. -- Los Angeles Times Sunday Book Review, Nicholas Christopher<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>ROBERT POLITO, editor, is a poet, biographer, and critic whose Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson received the National Book Critics Circle Award.

Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus P. Thompson and Martin Gardner has long been the most popular calculus primer. <BR><BR>This major revision of the classic math text makes the subject at hand still more comprehensible to readers of all levels. With a new introduction, three new chapters, modernized language and methods throughout, and an appendix of challenging and enjoyable practice problems, Calculus Made Easy has been thoroughly updated for the modern reader.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Scientific American<BR>Equal-opportunity reviewers, we welcome a book on behalf of the continuum! It is for the mathematically eager who know some algebra. The first edition appeared anonymously in 1910 in England, and overall a million copies have been sold. In fact, most talk of continuum and its infinities is suppressed; the eye is nicely fixed on little bits of x, called dx, their differences and sums among all kinds of functions, their geometric meaning, and what they can do for you--a lot. Martin Gardner, himself an American mathematical landmark, says, "This is the leanest and liveliest introduction to calculus ever written," and, taken with his own present augmentation, three whole chapters and more, including infinite series and some neat problems, he is quite right. The times they are a-changing, and we admit we are not current in computer resources. Maybe "little bits of x" ought to--or have been--placed on the screen in a serious pedagogic structure that students can manipulate. Graphics programs that share the scope and spirit of Thompson/Gardner would make a valued complement to their paper-and-pencil book.<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Calculus Made Easy is arguably the best math teaching ever.

Thucydides wrote the story of the first democracy in history, and of the fortunes and fall of its empire, but his pages contain the modern world-scene in miniature. The tale is told by a great political thinker, whose penetrating insight and dramatic power caused Macaulay to call him the 'greatest historian that ever lived.' His work, slightly abridged, is here presented in translation with an introduction and notes.

French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville's classic treatise on the American way of life.<BR><BR>Over 175 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville, an astute political scientist, came to the United States to evaluate the meaning and actual functioning of democracy. Here, Tocqueville discusses the advantages and dangers of majority rule--which he thought could be as tyrannical as the rule of a monarchy. He analyzes the influence of political parties and the press on the government and the effect of equality on the social, political, and economic life of the American people. He also offers some startling predictions about world politics, which history has borne out. So brilliant and penetrating are his comments and criticisms, they have vital meaning today for all who are interested in democracy.<BR><BR>Abridged and with an Introduction by Richard D. Heffner<BR>and an Afterword by Vartan Gregorian<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"No better study of a nation's institutions and culture than Tocqueville's Democracy in America has ever been written by a foreign observer."--The New York Times<BR><BR>"An extremely skillful job which gives us the essence of Tocqueville's great commentary."--Richard Hofstadter<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Alexis de Tocqueville was born in 1805 to a noble French family that had survived the French Revolution. His father gained some political power under the reign of the Bourbons, and after the July Revolution of 1830, the family was exiled along with the king. Tocqueville, then twenty-five years old, stayed in France, swearing allegiance to the new government. Shortly thereafter he and a friend, Gustave de Beaumont, sought and received a government assignment to study the prison system of the United States. They arrived in America in 1831. After extensive travels across the young nation, Tocqueville wrote Democracy in America (published in two volumes in 1835 and 1840). The publication of the first volume made Tocqueville a well-known figure, but he led a quiet life, accepting modest governmental posts, traveling around Europe, and marrying an Englishwoman. In 1848, Tocqueville once again rose to political prominence after a prescient speech that foretold of revolution. After serving through the massive upheavals and overthrows of government, Tocqueville retired from political life in 1849. Always weak in health, his lung disease grew progressively worse from that period on. Moving south several times on doctor's recommendations, Tocqueville succumbed to death in Cannes in 1859.<BR><BR>Richard D. Heffner received his A.B. and M.A. from Columbia University and has taught history and political science at the University of California, Sarah Lawrence College, and the New School for Social Research. He has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy at Rutgers since 1964. Mr. Heffner also produces and moderates his prize-winning weekly public television series, The Open Mind, and for twenty years was Chairman of the motion picture industry's film rating system. In addition to Democracy in America, Mr. Heffner is the editor of the Mentor book A Documentary History of the United States.<BR><BR>Vartan Gregorian is the twelfth president of Carnegie Corporation of New York. Prior to his current position, Gregorian served for nine years (1989-1997) as president of Brown University and for eight years (1981-1989) as President of the New York Public Library. He became founding dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 and four years later became its twenty-third provost. Gregorian, an historian, was a professor at San Francisco State University, UCLA, University of Texas at Austin, Penn, and Brown.

TOLKIEN'S CLASSIC THE LORD OF THE RINGS, WHICH CONTINUES IN THE TWO TOWERS AND THE RETURN OF THE KING.<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. After serving in World War I, he embarked upon a distinguished academic career and was recognized as one of the finest philologists in the world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. He is, however, beloved throughout the world as the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic works as The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He died on September 2, 1973, at the age of eighty-one.<BR><BR>Excerpt. ® Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<BR>A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY <BR><BR>When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.<BR><BR>Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable dis- appearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.<BR><BR>'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and trouble will come of it!<BR><BR>But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.<BR><BR>The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. 'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.<BR><BR>Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an important number: the date of his 'coming of age'.<BR><BR>Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.<BR><BR>No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.<BR><BR>'A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always said, the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables--in the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).<BR><BR>'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?' asked Old Noakes of Bywater. 'Baggins is his name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.<BR><BR>'And no wonder they're queer,' put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's next-door neighbour), 'if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.<BR><BR>'You' re right, Dad!' said the Gaffer. 'Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river--and that isn't natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.<BR><BR>'Drownded?' said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again.<BR><BR>'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer. 'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo' s first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took' s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.<BR><BR>'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.<BR><BR>'And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.<BR><BR>'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.<BR><BR>'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won't never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.<BR><BR>'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. 'All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I've heard.<BR><BR>'Then you' ve heard more than I can speak to,' answered the Gaffer. 'I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I'd not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He's in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo's tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters--meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.<BR><BR>'Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you'll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.<BR><BR>But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo's wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.<BR><BR>'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first, argued the miller, voicing common opinion. 'He's often away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.

He wondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. The dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of the South marched past. Sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain.<BR><BR>There had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt, and then in the dawn he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the silent town and the great empty house on the hill. And hardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again, and men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then again riding, riding in the night. This was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.<BR><BR>A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers. Pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. So the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. He stirred and spoke.<BR><BR>'Where are we, Gandalf?' he asked.<BR><BR>'In the realm of Gondor,' the wizard answered. 'The land of Anórien is still passing by.'<BR><BR>There was a silence again for a while. Then, 'What is that?' cried Pippin suddenly, clutching at Gandalf's cloak. 'Look! Fire, red fire! Are there dragons in this land? Look, there is another!'<BR><BR>For answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. 'On, Shadowfax! We must hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Dîn, and flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad, and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan.'<BR><BR>But Shadowfax paused in his stride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.<BR><BR>Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to Rohan in the North, or to Belfalas in the South. 'It is long since the beacons of the North were lit,' he said; 'and in the ancient days of Gondor they were not needed, for they had the Seven Stones.' Pippin stirred uneasily.<BR><BR>'Sleep again, and do not be afraid!' said Gandalf. 'For you are not going like Frodo to Mordor, but to Minas Tirith, and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or the Ring is taken, then the Shire will be no refuge.'<BR><BR>'You do not comfort me,' said Pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was, and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the coming of the day.<BR><BR>Pippin woke to the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, and chill grey mists were about them. Shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed.<BR><BR>'Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,' said the leader of the men, 'and you know the passwords of the Seven Gates and are free to go forward. But we do not know your companion. What is he? A dwarf out of the mountains in the North? We wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.'<BR><BR>'I will vouch for him before the seat of Denethor,' said Gandalf. 'And as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through more battles and perils than you have, Ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of Isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him, or I would wake him. His name is Peregrin, a very valiant man.'<BR><BR>'Man?' said Ingold dubiously, and the others laughed.<BR><BR>'Man!' cried Pippin, now thoroughly roused. 'Man! Indeed not! I am a hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by necessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!'<BR><BR>'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,' said Ingold. 'But what is a hobbit?'<BR><BR>'A Halfling,' answered Gandalf. 'Nay, not the one that was spoken of,' he added seeing the wonder in the men's faces. 'Not he, yet one of his kindred.'<BR><BR>'Yes, and one who journeyed with him,' said Pippin. 'And Boromir of your City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North, and at the last he was slain defending me from many foes.'<BR><BR>'Peace!' said Gandalf. 'The news of that grief should have been told first to the father.'<BR><BR>'It has been guessed already,' said Ingold; 'for there have been strange portents here of late. But pass on now quickly! For the Lord of Minas Tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son, be he man or--'<BR><BR>'Hobbit,' said Pippin. 'Little service can I offer to your lord, but what I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.'<BR><BR>'Fare you well!' said Ingold; and the men made way for Shadowfax, and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. 'May you bring good counsel to Denethor in his need, and to us all, Mithrandir!' Ingold cried. 'But you come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.'<BR><BR>'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,' answered Gandalf. 'And as for counsel, to you I would say that you are over-late in repairing the wall of the Pelennor. Courage will now be your best defence against the storm that is at hand--that and such hope as I bring. For not all the tidings that I bring are evil. But leave your trowels and sharpen your swords!'<BR><BR>'The work will be finished ere evening,' said Ingold. 'This is the last portion of the wall to be put in defence: the least open to attack, for it looks towards our friends of Rohan. Do you know aught of them? Will they answer the summons, think you?'<BR><BR>'Yes, they will come. But they have fought many battles at your back. This road and no road looks towards safety any longer. Be vigilant! But for Gandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host of foes coming out of Anórien and no Riders of Rohan. And you may yet. Fare you well, and sleep not!'

The extraordinary history of Middle-earth, edited by Christopher Tolkien<BR><BR>The Book of Lost Tales stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor. Embedded in English legend and English association, they were set in the narrative frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named Eriol (or Ælfwine) to Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, where Elves dwelt; from them he learned their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. In the Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of Gods and Elves; Dwarves and Orcs; the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; Nargothrond and Gondolin; and the geography and cosmology of the invented world.<BR><BR>Praise for Book of Lost Tales 1<BR><BR>"In these tales we have the scholar joyously gamboling in the thickets of his imagination. . . .

All rights reserved.<BR>THE COTTAGE OF LOST PLAY<BR><BR>On the cover of one of the now very battered 'High School Exercise Books' in which some of the Lost Tales were composed my father wrote: The Cottage of Lost Play, which introduced [the] Book of Lost Tales; and on the cover is also written, in my mother's hand, her initials, E.M.T., and a date, Feb. 12th 1917. In this book the tale was written out by my mother; and it is a fair copy of a very rough pencilled manuscript of my father's on loose sheets, which were placed inside the cover. Thus the date of the actual composition of this tale could have been, but probably was not, earlier than the winter of 1916-17. The fair copy follows the original text precisely; some further changes, mostly slight (other than in the matter of names), were then made to the fair copy. The text follows here in its final form.<BR><BR>Now it happened on a certain time that a traveller from far countries, a man of great curiosity, was by desire of strange lands and the ways and dwellings of unaccustomed folk brought in a ship as far west even as the Lonely Island, Tol EressÃa in the fairy speech, but which the Gnomes call Dor Faidwen, the Land of Release, and a great tale hangs thereto.<BR><BR>Now one day after much journeying he came as the lights of evening were being kindled in many a window to the feet of a hill in a broad and woody plain. He was now near the centre of this great island and for many days had wandered its roads, stopping each night at what dwelling of folk he might chance upon, were it hamlet or good town, about the hour of eve at the kindling of candles. Now at that time the desire of new sights is least, even in one whose heart is that of an explorer; and then even such a son of EÃrendel as was this wayfarer turns his thoughts rather to supper and to rest and the telling of tales before the time of bed and sleep is come.<BR><BR>Now as he stood at the foot of the little hill there came a faint breeze and then a flight of rooks above his head in the clear even light. The sun had some time sunk beyond the boughs of the elms that stood as far as eye could look about the plain, and some time had its last gold faded through the leaves and slipped across the glades to sleep beneath the roots and dream till dawn.<BR><BR>Now these rooks gave voice of home-coming above him, and with a swift turn came to their dwelling in the tops of some high elms at the summit of this hill. Then thought Eriol (for thus did the people of the island after call him, and its purport is 'One who dreams alone', but of his former names the story nowhere tells): 'The hour of rest is at hand, and though I know not even the name of this fair-seeming town upon a little hill here I will seek rest and lodging and go no further till the morrow, nor go even then perchance, for the place seems fair and its breezes of a good savour. To me it has the air of holding many secrets of old and wonderful and beautiful things in its treasuries and noble places and in the hearts of those that dwell within its walls.'<BR><BR>Now Eriol was coming from the south and a straight road ran before him bordered at one side with a great wall of grey stone topped with many flowers, or in places overhung with great dark yews. Through them as he climbed the road he could see the first stars shine forth, even as he afterwards sang in the song which he made to that fair city.<BR><BR>Now was he at the summit of the hill amidst its houses, and stepping as if by chance he turned aside down a winding lane, till, a little down the western slope of the hill, his eye was arrested by a tiny dwelling whose many small windows were curtained snugly, yet only so that a most warm and delicious light, as of hearts content within, looked forth. Then his heart yearned for kind company, and the desire for wayfaring died in him-and impelled by a great longing he turned aside at this cottage door, and knocking asked one who came and opened what might be the name of this house and who dwelt therein. And it was said to him that this was Mar Vanwa TyaliÃva, or the Cottage of Lost Play, and at that name he wondered greatly. There dwelt within, 'twas said, Lindo and VairÃ who had built it many years ago, and with them were no few of their folk and friends and children. And at this he wondered more than before, seeing the size of the cottage; but he that opened to him, perceiving his mind, said: 'Small is the dwelling, but smaller still are they that dwell here-for all who enter must be very small indeed, or of their own good wish become as very little folk even as they stand upon the threshold.'<BR><BR>Then said Eriol that he would dearly desire to come therein and seek of VairÃ and Lindo a night's guest-kindliness, if so they would, and if he might of his own good wish become small enough there upon the threshold. Then said the other, 'Enter,' and Eriol stepped in, and behold, it seemed a house of great spaciousness and very great delight, and the lord of it, Lindo, and his wife, VairÃ, came forth to greet him; and his heart was more glad within him than it had yet been in all his wanderings, albeit since his landing in the Lonely Isle his joy had been great enough.<BR><BR>And when VairÃ had spoken the words of welcome, and Lindo had asked of him his name and whence he came and whither he might be seeking, and he had named himself the Stranger and said that he came from the Great Lands, and that he was seeking whitherso his desire for travel led him, then was the evening meal set out in the great hall and Eriol bidden thereto. Now in this hall despite the summertide were three great fires-one at the far end and one on either side of the table, and save for their light as Eriol entered all was in a warm gloom. But at that moment many folk came in bearing candles of all sizes and many shapes in sticks of strange pattern: many were of carven wood and others of beaten metal, and these were set at hazard about the centre table and upon those at the sides.<BR><BR>At that same moment a great gong sounded far off in the house with a sweet noise, and a sound followed as of the laughter of many voices mingled with a great pattering of feet. Then VairÃ said to Eriol, seeing his face filled with a happy wonderment: 'That is the voice of Tombo, the Gong of the Children, which stands outside the Hall of Play Regained, and it rings once to summon them to this hall at the times for eating and drinking, and three times to summon them to the Room of the Log Fire for the telling of tales,' and added Lindo: 'If at his ringing once there be laughter in the corridors and a sound of feet, then do the walls shake with mirth and stamping at the three strokes in an evening. And the sounding of the three strokes is the happiest moment in the day of Littleheart the Gong-warden, as he himself declares who has known happiness enough of old; and ancient indeed is he beyond count in spite of his merriness of soul. He sailed in Wingilot with EÃrendel in that last voyage wherein they sought for Kôr. It was the ringing of this Gong on the Shadowy Seas that awoke the Sleeper in the Tower of Pearl that stands far out to west in the Twilit Isles.'<BR><BR>To these words did Eriol's mind so lean, for it seemed to him that a new world and very fair was opening to him, that he heard naught else till he was bidden by VairÃ« to be seated. Then he looked up, and lo, the hall and all its benches and chairs were filled with children of every aspect, kind, and size, while sprinkled among them were folk of all manners and ages. In one thing only were all alike, that a look of great happiness lit with a merry expectation of further mirth and joy lay on every face. The soft light of candles too was upon them all; it shone on bright tresses and gleamed about dark hair, or here and there set a pale fire in locks gone grey. Even as he gazed all arose and with one voice sang the song of the Bringing in of the Meats. Then was the food brought in and set before them, and thereafter the bearers and those that served and those that waited, host and hostess, children and guest, sat down: but Lindo first blessed both food and company. As they ate Eriol fell into speech with Lindo and his wife, telling them tales of his old days and of his adventures, especially those he had encountered upon the journey that had brought him to the Lonely Isle, and asking in return many things concerning the fair land, and most of all of that fair city wherein he now found himself.

All rights reserved.<BR>I<BR>THE TALE OF TINÚVIEL<BR><BR>The Tale of Tinúviel was written in 1917, but the earliest extant text is later, being a manuscript in ink over an erased original in pencil; and in fact my father's rewriting of this tale see,s to have been one of the last completed elements in the Lost Tales (see I.229-230).<BR><BR>There is also a typescript version of the Tale of Tinúviel, later than the manuscript but belonging to the same 'phase' of the mythology: my father had the manuscript before him and changed the text as he went along. Significant differences between the two versions of the tale are given on pp. 40ff.<BR><BR>In the manuscript the tale is headed: 'Link to the Tale of Tinúviel, also the Tale of Tinúviel.' The Link begins with the following passage:<BR><BR>'Great was the power of Melko for ill,' said Eriol, 'if he could indeed destroy with his cunning the happiness and glory of the Gods and Elves, darkening the light of their dwelling and bringing all their love to naught. This must surely be the worst deed that ever he has done.'<BR><BR>'Of a truth never has such evil again been done in Valinor,' said Lindao, 'but Melko's hand has laboured at worse things in the world, and the seeds of his evil have waxen since to a great and terrible growth.'<BR><BR>'Nay,' said Eriol, 'yet can my heart not think of other griefs, for sorrow at the destruction of those most fair Trees and the darkness of the world.'<BR><BR>This passage was struck out, and is not found in the typescript text, but it reappears in almost identical form at the end of The Flight of the Noldoli (I.188). The reason for this was that my father decided that the Tale of the Sun and Moon, rather than Tinúviel, should follow The Darkening of Valinor and The Flight of thte Noldoli (see I.229, where the complex question of the re-ordering of the Tales at this point is discussed). The opening words of the next part of the Link, 'Now in the days soon after the telling of this tale', referred, when they were written, to the tale of The Darkening of Valinor and The Flight of the Noldoli; but it is never made plain to what tale they were to refer when Tinúviel had been removed from its earlier position.<BR><BR>The two versions of the Link are at first very close, but when Eriol speaks of his own past history they diverge. For the earlier part I gave the typescript text alone, and when they diverge I give them both in succession. All discussion of this story of Eriol's life is postponed to Chapter VI.<BR><BR>Now in the days soon after the telling of this tale, behold, winter approached the land of Tol Eressëa, for now had Eriol forgetful of his wandering mood abode some time in old Kortition. Never in those months did he fare beyond the good tilth that lay without the grey walls of that town, but many a hall of the kindreds of the Inwir and the Teleri received him as their glad guest, and ever more skilled in the tongues of the Elves did he become, and more deep in knowledge of their customs, of their tales and songs.<BR><BR>Then was Winter come sudden upon the Lonely Isle, and the lawns and gardens drew on a sparkling mantle of white snows; their fountains were still, and all their bare trees silent, and the far sun glinted pale amid the mist or splintered upon facets of long hanging ice. Still fared Eriol not away, but watched the cold moon from the frosty skies look down upon Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva, and when above the roofs the stars gleamed blue he would listen, yet no sound of the flutes of Timpinen heard he now; for the breath of summer is that sprite, and or ever autumn's secret presence fills the air he takes his grey magic boat, but the swallows draw him far away.<BR><BR>Even so Eriol knew laughter and merriment and musics too, and song, in the dwellings of Kortirion - even Eriol the wanderer whose heart before had known no rest. Came now a grey day, and a wan afternoon, but within was firelight and good warmth and dancing and merry children's noise, for Eriol was making a great play with the maids and boys in the hall of Play Regained. There at length tired with their mirth they cast themselves down upon the rugs before the hearth, and a child among them, a little maid, said: 'Tell me, O Eriol, a tale!'<BR><BR>'What then shall I tell, O Vëannë?' saiad he, and she, clambering upon his knee, said: 'A tale of Men and of children in the Great Lands, or of thy home - and didst thou have a garden there such as we, where poppies grew and pansies like those that grow in my corner by the Arbour of the Thrushes?'<BR><BR>I give now the manuscript version of the remainder of the Link passage:<BR><BR>Then Eriol told her of his home that was in an old town of Men girt with a wall now crumbled and broken, and a river ran thereby over which a castle with a great bower hung. 'A very high tower indeed,' said he, 'and the moon climbed high or ever he thrust his face above it.' 'Was it then as high as Ingil's Tirin?' said Vëannë, but Eriol said that that he could not guess, for 'twas very many years agone since he had seen that castle or its tower, for 'O Vëannë,' said he, 'I lived there but a while, and not after I was grown to be a boy. My father came of a coastward folk, and the love of the sea that I had never seen was in my bones, and my father whetted my desire, for he told me tales that his father had told him before. Now my mother died in a cruel and hungry siege of that old town, and my father was slain in bitter fight about the walls, and in the end I Eriol escaped to the shoreland of the Western Sea, and mostly have lived upon the bosom of the waves or by its side since those far days.'<BR><BR>Now the children about were filled with sadness at the sorrows that fell on those dwellers in the Great Lands, and at the wars and death, and Vëannnë clung to Eriol, saying: 'O Melinon, never go to a war - or hast thou ever yet?'<BR><BR>'Aye, often enough,' said Eriol, 'but not to the great wars of the earthly kings and mighty nations which are cruel and bitter, and many fair lands and lovely things and even women and sweet maids such as thou Vëannë Melinir are whelmed by them in ruin; yet gallant affrays have I seen wherein small bands of brave men do sometimes meet and swift blows are dealt. But behold, why speak we of these things, little one; wouldst not hear rather of my first ventures on the sea?'<BR><BR>Then was there much eagerness a light, and Eriol told them of his wanderings about the western havens, of the comrades he made and the ports he knew, of how he was wrecked upon far western islands until at last upon one lonely one he came on an ancient sailor who gave him shelter, and over a fire within his lonely cabin told him strange tales of things beyond the Western Seas, of the Magic Isles and that most lonely one that lay beyond. Long ago had he once sighted it shining afar off, and after had he sought it many a day in vain.<BR><BR>'Ever after,' said Eriol, 'did I sail curiously about the western isles seeking more stories of the kind, and this it is indeed that after many great voyages I came myself by the blessing of the Gods to Tol Eressëa in the end -wherefore I now sit here talking to thee, Vëannë, till my words have run dry.'<BR><BR>Then nonetheless did a boy, Ausir, beg him to tell more of ships and the sea, but Eriol said: 'Nay - still is there time ere Ilfiniol ring the gong for evening meat: come, one of you children, tell me a tale that you have heard!' Then Vëannë sat up and clapped her hands, saying: 'I will tell you the Tale of Tinúviel.'<BR><BR>The typescript version of this passage reads as follows:<BR><BR>Then Eriol told of his home of long ago, that it was in an ancient town of Men girt with a wall now crumbled and broken, for the folk that dwelt there had long known days of rich and easy peace. A river ran thereby, o'er which a castle with a great tower hung. 'There dwelt a mighty duke,' said he, 'and did he gaze from the topmost battlements never might he see the bounds of his wide domain, save where far to the east the blue shapes of the great mountains lay - yet was that tower held the most lofty that stood in the lands of Men. 'Was it as high as great Ingil's Tirin?' said Vëannë, but said Eriol: 'A very high tower indeed was it, but I may not now guess how high, I Vëannë, for 'tis many years agone since last I saw that castle or its steep tower. War fell suddenly on that town amid its slumberous peace, nor were its crumbled walls able to withstand the onslaught of the wild men from the Mountains of the East. There perished my mother in that cruel and hungry siege, and my father was slain fighting bitterly about the walls in the last sack. In those far days was I not yet war-high, and a bondslave was I made.<BR><BR>'Know then that my father was come of a coastward folk ere he wandered to that place, and the longing for the sea that I had never seen was in my bones; which often had my father whettedl telling me tales of the wide waters and recalling lore that he had learned of his father aforetime. Small need to tell of my travail thereafter in thralldom, for in the end I brake my bonds and got me to the shoreland of the Western Sea - and mostly have I lived upon the bosom of its waves or by its side since those old days.'<BR><BR>Now hearing of the sorrows that fell upon the dwellers in the Great Lands, the wars and death, the children were filled with sadness, and Vëannë clung to Riol, saying: 'O Melinon, go thou never to a war - or hast thou ever yet?'<BR><BR>'Aye, often enough,' said Eriol, 'yet not to the great wars of the earthly kings and mighty nations, which are cruel and bitter, whelming in their ruin all the beauty both of the earth and of those fair things that men fashion with their hands in times of peace - nay, they spare not sweet women and tender maids, such as thou, Vëannë Melinir, for then are men drunk with wrath and the lust of blood, and Melko fares abroad. But gallant affrays have I seen wherein brave men did sometimes meet, and swift blows were dealt, and strength of body and of heart was proven - but, behold, why speak we of these things, little one? Wouldst not hear rather of my ventures on the sea?'<BR><BR>Then was there much eagerness alight, and Eriol told them of his first wanderings about the western havens, of the comrades he made, and the ports he knew; of how he was one time wrecked upon far western islands and there upon a lonely eyot found an ancient mariner who dwelt forever solitary in a cabin on the short, that he had fashioned of the timbers of his boat. 'More wise was he,' said Eriol, 'in all matters of the sea than any other I have met, and much wizardry was there in his lore. Strange things he told me of regions far beyond the Western Sea, of the Magic Isles and that most lonely one that lies behind. Once long ago, he said, he had sighted it glimmering afar off, and after had he sought it many a day in vain. Much lore he taught me of the hidden seas, and the dark and trackless waters, and without this never had I found this sweetest land, or this dear town or the Cottage of Lost Play - yet it was not without long and grievous search thereafter, and many a weary voyage, that I came myself by the blessing of the Gods to Tol Eressëa at the last -wherefore I now sit here talking to thee, Vëannë, till my words have run dry.'<BR><BR>Then nevertheless did a boy, Ausir, beg him to tell more of ships and the sea, saying: 'For knowest thou not, O Eriol, that that ancient mariner beside the lonely sea was none other than Ulmo's self, who appeareth not seldom thus to those voyagers whom he loves - yet he who has spoken with Ulmo must have many a tale to tell that will not be stale in the ears even of those that dwell here in Kortirion.' But Eriol at that time believed not that saying of Ausir's, and said: 'Nay, pay me your debt ere Ilfrin ring the gong for evening meat - come, one of you shall tell me a tale that you have heard.'

Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.<BR><BR>'I read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'Frodo ran to the hill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.<BR><BR>Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked out. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.<BR><BR>Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.<BR><BR>'The horn of Boromir!' he cried. 'He is in need!' He sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'Alas! An ill fate is on me this day, and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?<BR><BR>As he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed through the trees.<BR><BR>A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.<BR><BR>Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo,' he said. 'I am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.<BR><BR>'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.<BR><BR>'No!' said Aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'You have conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall not fall!<BR><BR>Boromir smiled.<BR><BR>'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' said Aragorn.<BR><BR>But Boromir did not speak again.<BR><BR>'Alas!' said Aragorn. 'Thus passes the heir of Denethor, Lord of the Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all in ruin. It is I that have failed. Vain was Gandalf's trust in me. What shall I do now? Boromir has laid it on me to go to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the Ring and the Bearer? How shall I find them and save the Quest from disaster?<BR><BR>He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.<BR><BR>'Alas!' said Legolas, coming to Aragorn's side. 'We have hunted and slain many Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We came when we heard the horn--but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken deadly hurt.<BR><BR>'Boromir is dead,' said Aragorn. 'I am unscathed, for I was not here with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.<BR><BR>'The hobbits!' cried Gimli. 'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?<BR><BR>'I do not know,' answered Aragorn wearily. 'Before he died Boromir told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I sent him to follow Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam were with him: not until it was too late. All that I have done today has gone amiss. What is to be done now?<BR><BR>'First we must tend the fallen,' said Legolas. 'We cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.<BR><BR>'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We must follow the Orcs, if there is hope that any of our Company are living prisoners.<BR><BR>'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them or not,' said Aragorn. 'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice is now before us!<BR><BR>'Then let us do first what we must do,' said Legolas. 'We have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A cairn we might build.<BR><BR>'The labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-side,' said Gimli.<BR><BR>'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.<BR><BR>Quickly they searched the bodies of the Orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap.<BR><BR>'See!' cried Aragorn. 'Here we find tokens!' He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'No orc-tools these!' he said. 'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.<BR><BR>'And I,' said Legolas, 'will take all the arrows that I can find, for my quiver is empty.' He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely.<BR><BR>And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here lie many that are not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!<BR><BR>There were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Orcs; and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal.<BR><BR>'I have not seen these tokens before,' said Aragorn. 'What do they mean?<BR><BR>'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.<BR><BR>'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.<BR><BR>'Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken, said Aragorn. 'And he does not use white. The Orcs in the service of Baraddûr use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess,' he said at length. 'There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lórien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning news. Do you remember the birds?<BR><BR>'Well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said Gimli. 'Let us bear Boromir away!<BR><BR>'But after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,' answered Aragorn.<BR><BR>'Maybe there is no right choice,' said Gimli.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.<BR><BR>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats--the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill--The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it--and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.<BR><BR>This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained--well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.<BR><BR>The mother of our particular hobbit--what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit--of Bilbo Baggins, that is--was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.<BR><BR>Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.<BR><BR>By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed)--Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.<BR><BR>All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.<BR><BR>"Good morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.<BR><BR>"What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"<BR><BR>"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.<BR><BR>"Very pretty!" said Gandalf. "But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."<BR><BR>"I should think so--in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.<BR><BR>"Good morning!" he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.<BR><BR>"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off."<BR><BR>"Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don't think I know your name?"<BR><BR>"Yes, yes, my dear sir--and I do know your name, Mr Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!"<BR><BR>"Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves--or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter--I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."

And never before had men been more divided.

NO ONE COULD STOP THEM--<BR>NOT STALIN, NOT TOGO, NOT CHURCHILL, NOT ROOSEVELT . . . <BR>The invaders had cut the United States virtually in half at the Mississippi, vaporized Washington, D.C., devastated much of Europe, and held large parts of the Soviet Union under their thumb.<BR>But humanity would not give up so easily.

Russia, Communist China, Japan, Nazi Germany, the United States: they began World War II as mortal enemies. But suddenly their only hope for survival--never mind victory--was to unite to stop a mighty foe--one whose frightening technology appeared invincible. <BR><BR>Far worse beings than the Nazis were loose. From Warsaw to Moscow to China's enemy-occupied Forbidden City, the nations of the world had been forced into an uneasy alliance since humanity began its struggle against overwhelming odds. In Germany, where the banshee wail of hostile jets screamed across the land, caches of once-forbidden weapons were unearthed, and unthinkable tactics were employed against the enemy. Brilliantly innovative military strategists confronted challenges unprecedented in the history of warfare. <BR><BR>Even as lack of fuel forced people back to horse and carriage, physicists worked feverishly to create the first nuclear bombs--with horrifying results. City after city joined the atomic pyre as the planet erupted in fiery ruins. Yet the crisis continued--on land, sea, and in the air--as humanity writhed in global combat. The tactics of daredevil guerrillas everywhere became increasingly ingenious against a superior foe whose desperate retaliation would grow ever more fearsome.<BR><BR>No one had ever put the United States, or the world, in such deadly danger. But if the carnage and annihilation ever stopped, would there be any pieces to pick up?<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>"Turtledove exhibits his genuine feel for crafting believable answers to historical 'what ifs.'" ---Library Journal<BR>- From the Publisher

All rights reserved.<BR>As the jet aircraft descended toward the airport outside the still slightly radioactive ruins of Nuremberg, Pshing asked Atvar, "Exalted Fleetlord, is this visit really necessary?"<BR><BR>"I believe it," the commander of the Race's conquest fleet told his adjutant. "My briefings state that a Tosevite wise in the political affairs of his kind recommended that a conqueror visit the region he conquered as soon as he could, to make those he had defeated aware of their new masters."<BR><BR>"Technically, the Greater German Reich remains independent," Pshing pointed out.<BR><BR>"So it does-technically. But that will remain a technicality, I assure you." Atvar used an emphatic cough to show how strongly he felt about that. "The Deutsche did us far too much harm in this exchange of explosive-metal weapons to let their madness ever break free again."<BR><BR>"A pity we had to concede them even so limited an independence," Pshing said.<BR><BR>"And that is also a truth," Atvar agreed with a sigh. He swiveled one eye turret toward the window to get another look at the glassy crater that filled the center of the former capital of the Greater German Reich. Beyond it lay a slagged wilderness of what remained of homes and factories and public buildings. Conventional bombs had devastated the airport, too, but it was back in service.<BR><BR>Pshing said, "If only we had some means of detecting their missile-carrying boats that can stay submerged indefinitely. Without those, we could have forced unconditional surrender out of them."<BR><BR>"Truth," Atvar repeated. "With them, though, they could have inflicted a good deal more damage to our colonies here on Tosev 3. They will be surrendering the submarines they have left. We shall not allow them to build more. We shall not allow them to have anything to do with atomic power or explosive-metal weapons henceforward."<BR><BR>"That is excellent. That is as it should be," Pshing said. "If only we could arrange to confiscate the submersible boats of the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as well, we would truly be on our way toward a definitive conquest of this miserable planet."<BR><BR>"I merely thank the spirits of Emperors past"-Atvar cast both his eye turrets down to the floor of the aircraft that carried him-"that neither of the other powerful not-empires chose to join the Deutsche against us. Together, they could have hurt us much worse than the Reich alone did."<BR><BR>"And now we also have the Nipponese to worry about," Pshing added. "Who knows what they will do, now that they have learned the art of constructing explosive-metal weapons? They already have submarines, and they already have missiles."<BR><BR>"We never did pay enough attention to islands and their inhabitants," Atvar said fretfully. "Small chunks of land surrounded by sea were never important back on Home, so we have always assumed the same would hold true here. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be so."<BR><BR>Before Pshing could answer, the aircraft's landing gear touched down on the runway outside Nuremberg. The Race's engineering, slowly refined through a hundred thousand years of planetary unity, was very fine, but not fine enough to keep Atvar from feeling some bumps as the aircraft slowed to a stop.<BR><BR>"My apologies, Exalted Fleetlord." The pilot's voice came back to him on the intercom. "I was given to understand repairs to the landing surface were better than is in fact the case."<BR><BR>Peering out the window, Atvar saw Deutsch males in the cloth wrappings that singled out their military drawn up in neat ranks to greet and honor him. They carried rifles. His security males had flabbled about that, but the Reich remained nominally independent. If some fanatic sought to assassinate him, his second-in-command in Cairo would do . . . well enough. "What was the name of the sly Big Ugly who suggested this course?" he asked Pshing.<BR><BR>"Machiavelli." His adjutant pronounced the alien name with care, one syllable at a time. "He lived and wrote about nine hundred years ago. Nine hundred of our years, I should say-half as many of Tosev 3's."<BR><BR>"So he came after our probe, then?" Atvar said, and Pshing made the affirmative gesture. The Race had studied Tosev 3 sixteen hundred years before: again, half that many in Tosevite terms. The fleetlord went on, "Remember the sword-swinging savage mounted on an animal the probe showed us? He was the height of Tosevite military technology in those days."<BR><BR>"A pity he did not remain the height of Tosevite military technology, as we were so confident he would," Pshing said. "When we understand how the Big Uglies are able to change so rapidly, we will be able to prevent them from doing so in the future. That will help bind them to the Empire."<BR><BR>"So it will . . . if we can do it," Atvar replied. "If not, we will wreck them one not-empire at a time. Or, if necessary, we will destroy this whole world, even our colonies on it. That will cauterize it once for all."<BR><BR>One other possibility remained, a possibility that had never entered his mind when the conquest fleet first reached Tosev 3: the Big Uglies might conquer the Race. If they did, they would next mount an attack on Home. Atvar was as sure of it as of the fact that he'd hatched from an egg. Wrecking the world would prevent it, as a surgeon sometimes had to prevent death by cutting out a tumor.<BR><BR>With the Reich prostrate, the Big Uglies would have a much harder time of it. Atvar knew that. But the worry never went away. The locals were quicker, more adaptable, than the Race. He knew that, too; close to fifty of his years of experience on Tosev 3 had burned the lesson into him again and again.<BR><BR>Clunks and bangings from up ahead came to his hearing diaphragm: the aircraft's door opening. He did not go forward at once; his security males would disembark ahead of him to form what was termed a ceremonial guard and amounted to a defensive perimeter. It would not hold against concerted attack; it might keep a single crazed Big Ugly from murdering him. Atvar hoped it would.<BR><BR>One of those security males came back to his seat and bent into the posture of respect. "All is in readiness, Exalted Fleetlord," he reported. "And the radioactivity level is acceptably low."<BR><BR>"I thank you, Diffal," Atvar said. The male had headed Security since midway through the fighting. He wasn't so good as his predecessor, Drefsab, but Drefsab had fallen victim to Big Uglies with even more nasty talents-or perhaps just more luck-than he'd had. Atvar turned an eye turret toward Pshing. "Come with me."<BR><BR>"It shall be done, Exalted Fleetlord," his adjutant said.<BR><BR>Atvar let out a hiss of disgust at the weather outside, which was chilly and damp. Cairo, whence he'd come, had a reasonably decent climate. Nuremberg didn't come close. And this was spring, heading toward summer. Winter would have been much worse. Atvar shivered at the very idea.<BR><BR>As he emerged from his aircraft, a Deutsch military band began braying away. The Big Uglies meant it as an honor, not an insult, and so he endured the unmusical-at least to his hearing diaphragms-racket. The security officials parted to let a Big Ugly through: not the Führer of the Deutsche, but a protocol aide. "If you advance to the end of the carpet, Exalted Fleetlord, the Führer will meet you there," he said, using the language of the Race about as well as a Tosevite could.<BR><BR>Making the gesture of agreement, Atvar advanced to the edge of the strip of red cloth and stopped. His security males kept him covered and kept themselves between him and the ranks of the Deutsche. The Tosevite soldiers looked fierce and barbaric, and had proved themselves formidable in battle. They are beaten now, Atvar reminded himself. They didn't seem beaten, though. By their bearing, they were ready to go right back to war.<BR><BR>Their ranks parted slightly. Out from among them came a relatively short, rather stout Big Ugly in wrappings related to those of the soldiers but fancier. He wore a cap on his head. The hair Atvar could see below it was white, which meant he was not young. When he took off the cap for a moment, he showed that most of his scalp was bare, another sign of an aging male Tosevite.<BR><BR>As the Deutsche had parted, so, rather more reluctantly, did Atvar's security males. The Big Ugly walked up to Atvar and shot out his arm in salute. Being still formally independent, he did not have to assume the posture of respect. "I greet you, Exalted Fleetlord," he said. He was less fluent in Atvar's language than his protocol officer, but he made himself understood. "I am Walter Dornberger, Führer and Chancellor of the Greater German Reich."<BR><BR>"And I greet you, Führer." Atvar knew he made a hash of the Deutsch word, but it didn't matter. "Your males fought bravely. Now the fighting is over. You shall have to learn that fighting bravely and fighting wisely are not the same."<BR><BR>"Had I led the Reich when this war began, it would not have begun," Dornberger replied. "But my superiors thought differently. Now they are dead, and I have to pick up the pieces they left behind."<BR><BR>That was Tosevite idiom; the Race would have spoken of putting an eggshell back together. But Atvar understood. "You shall have fewer pieces with which to work henceforward. We intend to make certain of that. You did too much harm to us to be trusted any longer."<BR><BR>"I understand," Dornberger said. "The terms you...

All rights reserved.<BR>Atvar, the commander of the Race's conquest fleet, poked a control with a fingerclaw. A holographic image sprang into being above the projector in the fleetlord's office. In the forty years since the conquest fleet came to Tosev 3 (half that many local years), he had grown all too intimately familiar with that particular image.<BR><BR>So had Kirel, shiplord of the 127th Emperor Hetto, the bannership of the conquest fleet. The body paint on his scaly, green-brown hide was more ornate than every other male's save only Atvar's. His mouth fell open in amusement, revealing a great many small, sharp teeth. A slight waggle to his lower jaw gave his laughter a sardonic twist.<BR><BR>"Once more we behold the might Tosevite warrior, eh, Exalted Fleetlord?" he said. He ended the sentence with an interrogative cough.<BR><BR>"Even so, Shiplord," Atvar answered. "Even so. He does not look as if he would cause us much trouble, does he?"<BR><BR>"By the Emperor, no," Kirel said. Both Atvar and he swiveled their turreted eyes so they looked down at the ground for a moment: a gesture of respect for the sovereign back on distant Home.<BR><BR>As Atvar had done so many times before, he walked around the hologram to view it from all sides. The Tosevite male was mounted on a hairy local quadruped. He wore a tunic of rather rusty chain armor, and over it a light cloth coat. A pointed iron helmet protected his braincase. Tufts of yellowish hair grew like dry grass on his scaleless, pinkish cheeks and jaw. For armament, he had a spear, a sword, a knife, and a shield with a cross painted in red on it.<BR><BR>A long, hissing sigh escaped Atvar. "If only it had been as easy as we thought it would be."<BR><BR>"Truth, Exalted Fleetlord," Kirel said. "Who would have thought the Big Uglies"-the nickname the Race used for its Tosevite subjects and neighbors-"could have changed so much in a mere sixteen hundred years?"<BR><BR>"No one," Atvar said. "No one at all." He used a different cough this time, one that emphasized the words preceding it. They deserved emphasis. The Race-and the Hallessi and Rabotevs, whose planets the Empire had ruled for thousands of years-changed only very slowly, only very cautiously. For the Race, one millennium was like another. After sending a probe to Tosev 3, everyone back on Home had blithely assumed the barbarians there would not have changed much by the time the conquest fleet arrived.<BR><BR>Never in its hundred thousand years of unified imperial history-and never in the chaotic times before, for that matter-had the Race got a larger and more unpleasant surprise. When the conquest fleet did reach Tosev 3, it found not sword-swinging savages but a highly industrialized world with several empires and not-empires battling one another for dominance.<BR><BR>"Even after all these years, there are times when I still feel rage that we did not completely conquer this planet," Atvar said. "But, on the other fork of the tongue, there are also times when I feel nothing but relief that we still maintain control over any part of its surface."<BR><BR>"I understand, Exalted Fleetlord," Kirel said.<BR><BR>"I know you do, Shiplord. I am glad you do," Atvar said. "But I do wonder if anyone back on Home truly understands. I have the dubious distinction of commanding the first interstellar conquest fleet in the history of the Race that did not conquer completely. That is not how I intended hatchlings to remember me."<BR><BR>"Conditions here were not as we anticipated them," Kirel said loyally. He'd had his chances to be disloyal, had them and not taken them. By now, Atvar was willing to believe he wouldn't. He went on, "Do you not agree that there is a certain amount of irony in the profit we have made off the Tosevites by selling them this image and others from the probe? Their own scholars desire those photographs because they have none of their own from what seems to them to be a distant and uncivilized time."<BR><BR>"Irony? Yes, that is one of the words I might apply to the situation-one of the politer words," Atvar said. He went back to his desk and prodded the control again. The Tosevite warrior vanished. He wished he could make all the Tosevites vanish that easily, but no such luck. He replaced the warrior's image with a map of the surface of Tosev 3.<BR><BR>By his standards, it was a chilly world, with too much water and not enough land. Of what land there was, the Race did not rule enough. Only the southern half of the lesser continental mass, the southwest and south of the main continental mass, and the island continent to the southeast of the main continental mass were reassuringly red on the map. The not-empires of the Americans, the Russkis, and the Deutsche all remained independent, and needed colors of their own. So did the island empires of Britain and Nippon, though both of them were shrunken remnants of what they had been when the conquest fleet came to Tosev 3.<BR><BR>Kirel also turned one eye toward the map, while keeping the other on Atvar. "Truly, Exalted Fleetlord, it could be worse."<BR><BR>"So it could," Atvar said with another sigh. "But it could also be a great deal better. It would be a great deal better if these areas here on the eastern part of the main continental mass, especially this one called China, acknowledged our rule as they should."<BR><BR>"I have long since concluded that the Big Uglies never do things as they should," Kirel said.<BR><BR>"I agree completely," the fleetlord replied. His little tailstump twitched in agitation. "But how are we to convince the fleetlord of the colonization fleet that this is the case?"<BR><BR>Now Kirel sighed. "I do not know. He lacks our experience with this world. Once he acquires it, he will, I am sure, come round to our way of thinking. But we must expect him to be rigid for a time."<BR><BR>Back on Home, rigid was a term of praise. It had been a term of praise when the conquest fleet come to Tosev 3, too. No more. Males of the Race who stayed too rigid stood not a chance of understanding the Big Uglies. By the standards of Home, the males of the conquest fleet-those who still survived-had grown dreadfully flighty.<BR><BR>Males ... Atvar said, "It will be good to have females in range of the scent receptors on my tongue once more. When they come into season and I smell their pheromones, I will have an excuse for not thinking about this accursed world for a while. I look forward to having the excuse, you understand, not to the breeding itself."<BR><BR>"Of course, Exalted Fleetlord," Kirel said primly. "You are no Big Ugly, to have such matters always on your mind."<BR><BR>"I should hope not!" Atvar exclaimed. Like any other member of the Race, he viewed Tosevite sexuality with a sort of horrified fascination. Intellectually, he grasped how the Big Uglies' year-round interest in mating colored every aspect of their behavior. But he had no feel for the subtleties, or indeed for what the Big Uglies no doubt viewed as broad strokes. Despite intensive research, few males of the Race did, any more than the Tosevites could understand the Race's dispassionate view of such matters.<BR><BR>Pshing, Atvar's adjutant, came into the chamber. One side of his body was painted in a pattern that matched the fleetlord's; the other showed his own, far lower, rank. He bent his forward sloping torso into the posture of respect and waited to be noticed.<BR><BR>"Speak," Atvar said. "Give forth."<BR><BR>"I thank you, Exalted Fleetlord," Pshing said. "I beg leave to report that the lead ships of the colonization fleet have passed within the orbit of Tosev 4, the planet the Big Uglies call Mars. Very soon now, those ships will seek to circle and land on this world."<BR><BR>"I am aware of this, yes." Atvar's voice was even drier than the desert surrounding the riverside city-Cairo, the local name for it was-where he made his headquarters. "Is my distinguished colleague in the colonization fleet aware that the Tosevites, for all their protestations of peaceful intent, may seek to harm his ships when they do reach Tosev 3?"<BR><BR>"Fleetlord Reffet continues to assure me that he is," Pshing replied. "He was quite taken aback to receive radio transmissions from the various Tosevite not-empires."<BR><BR>"He should not have been," Atvar said. "We have been warning him for some time of the Big Uglies' ever-increasing capacities."<BR><BR>Kirel said, "Exalted Fleetlord, he will have to learn by experience, as we also had to do. Let us hope his experience proves less painful than ours."<BR><BR>"Indeed." Atvar let out a worried hiss. His voice grew grim: "And let us hope all the Tosevites take seriously our warning to them that an attack on the colonization fleet by any of them will be construed as an attack by all of them, and that we shall do our utmost to punish all of them should any such attack occur."<BR><BR>"I wish we had not had to issue such a warning," Kirel said.<BR><BR>"So do I," Atvar replied. "But least four and perhaps five of their realms possess missile-firing undersea ships-who back on Home would have dreamt of such things?"<BR><BR>"Oh, I understand the problem," Kirel said. "But the general warning all but invites the Tosevites to combine against us and to reduce their conflicts among themselves."<BR><BR>"Diplomacy." Atvar made the word into a curse. Manuals on the subject, their data gleaned from the Race's ancient history and early conquests, suggested playing the locals off against one another. But, to Atvar and his colleagues, such concerns were but theory, and musty theory at that. The Big Uglies, divided among themselves, were expert practitioners of the art. After a negotiating session with them, Atvar always wanted to count his fingers and toes to make sure he hadn't inadvertently traded them away.<BR><BR>Pshing said, "When the colonists are revived from cold sleep, when they come down to Tosev 3, we will begin to turn this into a proper world of the Empire."<BR><BR>"I admire your confidence, Adjutant," Kirel said. Pshing crouched respectfully. Kirel went on, "I wonder what the colonists will make of us. We are hardly proper males of the Race ourselves any more-dealing with the Tosevites for so long has left us as addled as bad eggs."<BR><BR>"We have changed," Atvar agreed. Back on Home, that would have been a curse. Not here, though he had taken a long time to realize it. "Had we not changed, our war with the Big Uglies would have wrecked this planet, and what would the colonization fleet have done then?"<BR><BR>Not a single male on Tosev 3 had found an answer to that question. Atvar was sure Reffet would have no answer for it, either. But he was also sure the fleetlord of the colonization fleet would have questions of his own. Would he himself, would any male on Tosev 3, be able to find answers for them?<BR><BR>The pitcher windmilled into his delivery. The runner took off from first base. The batter hit a sharp ground ball to short. The shortstop gobbled it up and fired it over to first. The softball slapped Sam Yeager's mitt, beating the runner to the bag by a step and a half. The umpire had hustled up from behind home plate. "You're out!" he yelled, and threw his fist in the air.<BR><BR>"That's the ballgame," Yeager said happily. "Another win for the good guys." He tacked on an emphatic cough for good measure.<BR><BR>"Nice game, Major," the pitcher said. "A homer and a double-I guess we'll take that."<BR><BR>"Thanks, Eddie," Yeager said, chuckling. "I can still get around on a softball." He was in his mid-fifties, and in good shape for his mid-fifties, but he couldn't hit a baseball for beans any more. It irked him; he'd been in his eighteenth season of minor-league ball when the Lizards came, and he'd kept playing as much and as long as he could after going into the Army.<BR><BR>He rolled the softball toward the chicken-wire dugout in back of first base. He'd been an outfielder when he played for money, but he couldn't cover the ground out there any more, either, so nowadays he played first. He could still catch and he could still throw.<BR><BR>A couple of guys from the other team came over and shook his hand. They'd been playing just for the fun of playing. He'd had fun, too-he wouldn't have put on spikes if he didn't have fun-but he'd gone out there to win. Playing for money for all those years had ingrained that in him.<BR><BR>Up in the wooden bleachers behind the wire fence, Barbara clapped her hands along with the other wives and girlfriends. Sam doffed his cap and bowed. His wife made a face at him. That wasn't why he put the cap back on in a hurry, though. He was getting thin on top, and Southern California summer sunshine was no joke. He'd sunburned his scalp a couple of times, but he intended never, ever, to do it again.<BR><BR>"Head for Jose's!" Win or lose, that cry rang out after a game. Winning would make the tacos and beer even better. Sam and Barbara piled into their Buick and drove over to the restaurant. It was only a few blocks from the park.<BR><BR>The Buick ran smoothly and quietly. Like more and more cars every year, it burned hydrogen, not gasoline-technology borrowed from the Lizards. Sam coughed when he got stuck behind an old gas-burner that poured out great gray clouds of stinking exhaust. "Ought to be a law against those miserable things," he complained.<BR><BR>Barbara nodded. "They've outlived their usefulness, that's certain." She spoke with the precision of someone who'd done graduate work in English. Yeager minded his p's and q's more closely than he would have had he not been married to someone like her.<BR><BR>At Jose's, the team hashed over the game. Sam was ten years older than anybody else and the only one who'd ever played pro ball, so his opinions carried weight. His opinion in other areas carried weight, too; Eddie, the pitcher, said, "You deal with the Lizards all the time, Major. What's it going to be like when that big fleet gets here?"<BR><BR>"Can't know for sure till it does get here," Yeager answered. "If you want to know what I think, I think it'll be the biggest day since the conquest fleet came down. We're all doing our best to make sure it isn't the bloodiest day since the conquest fleet came down, too."<BR><BR>Eddie nodded, accepting that. Barbara raised an eyebrow-just a little, so only Sam noticed. She saw the logical flaw the young pitcher missed. If all of mankind wanted the colonization fleet to land peacefully, that would happen. But no one on this side of the Atlantic could guess what Molotov or Himmler might do till he did it-if he did it. And the Nazis and the Reds-and the Lizards-would be worrying about President Warren, too.<BR><BR>After Sam finished his glass of Burgermeister, Barbara said, "I don't want to rush you too much, but we did tell Jonathan we'd be home when he got back."<BR><BR>"Okay." Yeager got up, set a couple of bucks on the table to cover food and drink, and said his goodbyes. Everybody-including Jose from behind the counter-waved when he and Barbara took off.<BR><BR>They lived over in Gardena, one of the suburbs on the west side of L.A. that had burgeoned since the end of the fighting. When they got out of the car, Barbara remarked, as she often did, "Cooler here."<BR><BR>"It's the sea breeze," Sam answered, as he often did. Then he plucked at his flannel uniform top. "It may be cooler, but it's not that cool. I'm going to hop in the shower, is what I'm going to do."<BR><BR>"That would be a very good idea, I think," Barbara said. Yeager stuck out his tongue at her. They both laughed, comfortable with each other. Why not? Sam thought. They'd been together since late 1942, only a few months after the conquest fleet arrived. Had the Lizards not come, they never would have met. Sam didn't like thinking about that; Barbara was the best thing that had ever happened to him.<BR><BR>To keep from dwelling on might-have-beens, he hurried into the house. Photographs in the hallway that led to the bathroom marked the highlights of his career: him in dress uniform just after being promoted from sergeant to lieutenant; him weightless, wearing olive-drab undershirt and trousers, aboard an orbiting Lizard spaceship-overheated by human standards-as he helped dicker a truce after a flare-up; him in a spacesuit on the pitted surface of the moon; him in captain's uniform, standing between Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon.<BR><BR>He grinned at that last one, which he sometimes had to explain to guests. If he hadn't been reading the science-fiction pulps, and especially Astounding, he never would have become a specialist in Lizard-human relations. Having been overrun by fact, science fiction wasn't what it had been before the Lizards came, but it still had some readers and some writers, and he'd never been a man to renounce his roots.<BR><BR>He showered quickly, shaved even more quickly, and put on a pair of chinos and a yellow cotton short-sleeved sport shirt. When he got a beer from the refrigerator, Barbara gave him a piteous look, so he handed it to her and grabbed another one for himself.<BR><BR>He'd just taken his first sip when the door opened. "I'm home!" Jonathan called.<BR><BR>"We're in the kitchen," Yeager said.<BR><BR>Jonathan hurried in. At eighteen, he hurried everywhere. "I'm hungry," he said, and added an emphatic cough.<BR><BR>"Make yourself a sandwich," Barbara said crisply. "I'm your mother, not your waitress, even if you do have trouble remembering it."<BR><BR>"Take your tongue out of the ginger jar, Mom. I will," Jonathan said, a piece of slang that wouldn't have meant a thing before the Lizards came. He wore only shorts that closely matched his suntanned hide. Across that hide were the bright stripes and patterns of Lizard-style body paint.<BR><BR>"You've promoted yourself," Sam remarked. "Last week, you were a landcruiser driver, but now you're an infantry small-unit group leader-a lieutenant, more or less."<BR><BR>Jonathan paused with his salami sandwich half built. "The old pattern was getting worn,"he answered with a shrug. "The paints you can buy aren't nearly as good as the ones the Lizards-"<BR><BR>"Nearly so good," his mother broke in, precise as usual.<BR><BR>"Nearly so good, then," Jonathan said, and shrugged again. "They aren't, and so I washed them off and put on this new set. I like it better, I think-brighter."<BR><BR>"Okay." Sam shrugged, too. People his son's age took the Lizards for granted in a way he never could. The youngsters didn't know what the world had been like before the conquest fleet came. They didn't care, either, and laughed at their elders for waxing nostalgic about it. Recalling his own youth, Sam did his best to be patient. It wasn't always easy. Before he could stop himself, he asked, "Did you really have to shave your head?"<BR><BR>That flicked a nerve, where talk about body paint hadn't. Jonathan turned, sliding a hand over the smooth and shining dome of his skull. "Why shouldn't I?" he asked, the beginning of an angry rumble in his voice. "It's the hot thing to do these days."<BR><BR>Along with body paint, it made people look as much like Lizards as they could. Hot was a term of approval because the Lizards liked heat. The Lizards liked ginger, too, but that was a different story.<BR><BR>Sam ran a hand through his own thinning hair. "I'm going bald whether I want to or not, and I don't. I guess I have trouble understanding why anybody who's got hair would want to cut it all off."<BR><BR>"It's hot," Jonathan repeated, as if that explained everything. To him, no doubt, it did. His voice lost some of that belligerent edge as he realized his father wasn't insisting that he let his hair grow, only talking about it. When he didn't feel challenged, he could be rational enough.<BR><BR>He took an enormous bite from his sandwich. He was three or four inches taller than Sam-over six feet instead of under-and broader through the shoulders. By the way he ate, he should have been eleven feet tall and seven feet wide.<BR><BR>His second bite was even bigger than the first. He was still chewing when the telephone rang. "That's got to be Karen!" he said with his mouth full, and dashed away.<BR><BR>Barbara and Sam shared looks of mingled amusement and alarm. "In my day, girls didn't call boys like that," Barbara said. "In my day, girls didn't shave their heads, either. Go on, call me a fuddy-duddy."<BR><BR>"You're my fuddy-duddy," Sam said fondly. He slipped an arm around her waist and gave her a quick kiss.<BR><BR>"I'd better be," Barbara said. "I'm glad I am, too, because there are so many more distractions now. In my day, even if there had been body paint, girls wouldn't have been so thorough about wearing it as boys are-and if they had been, they'd have been arrested for indecent exposure."<BR><BR>"Things aren't the same as they used to be," Sam allowed. His eyes twinkled. "I might call that a change for the better, though."<BR><BR>Barbara elbowed him in the ribs. "Of course you might. That doesn't mean I have to agree with you, though. And"-she lowered her voice so Jonathan wouldn't hear-"I'm glad Karen isn't one of the ones who do."<BR><BR>"Well, so am I," Sam said, although with a sigh that earned him another pointed elbow. "Jonathan and his pals are a lot more used to skin than I am. I'd stare like a fool if she came over dressed-or not dressed-that way."<BR><BR>"And then you'd tell me you were just reading what her rank was," Barbara said. "You'd think I love you enough to believe a whopper like that. And you know what?" She poked him again. "You might even be right."<BR><BR>Felless had not expected to wake in weightlessness. For a moment, staring up at the fluorescent lights overhead, she wondered if something had gone wrong with the ship. Then, thinking more slowly than she should have because of the lingering effects of cold sleep, she realized how foolish that was. Had something gone wrong with the ship, she would never have awakened at all.<BR><BR>Two people floated into view. One, by her body paint, was a physician. The other ... Weak and scatterbrained as Felless was, she gave a startled hiss. "Exalted Fleetlord!" she exclaimed. She heard her own voice as if from far away.<BR><BR>Fleetlord Reffet spoke not to her but to the physician: "She recognizes me, I see. Is she capable of real work?"<BR><BR>"We would not have summoned you here, Exalted Fleetlord, were she incapable," the physician replied. "We understand the value of your time."<BR><BR>"Good," Reffet said. "That is a concept the males down on the surface of Tosev 3 seem to have a great deal of trouble grasping." He swung one of his eye turrets to bear on Felless. "Senior Researcher, are you prepared to begin your duties at once?"<BR><BR>"Exalted Fleetlord, I am," Felless replied. Now the voice her hearing diaphragms caught seemed more like her own. Antidotes and restoratives were routing the drugs that had kept her just this side of death on the journey from Home to Tosev 3. Curiosity grew along with bodily well-being. "May I ask why I have been awakened prematurely?"<BR><BR>"You may," Reffet said, and then, in an aside to the physician, "You were right. Her wits are clear." He gave his attention back to Felless. "You have been awakened because conditions on Tosev 3 are not as we anticipated they would be when we set out from Home."<BR><BR>That was almost as great a surprise as waking prematurely. "In what way, Exalted Fleetlord?" Felless tried to make her wits work harder. "Does this planet harbor some bacterium or virus for which we have had difficulty in finding a cure?" Such a thing hadn't happened on either Rabotev 2 or Halless 1, but remained a theoretical possibility.<BR><BR>"No," Reffet replied. "The difficulty lies in the natives themselves. They are more technically advanced than our probe indicated. You being the colonization fleet's leading expert on relations between the Race and other species, I judged it expedient to rouse you and put you to work before we make planetfall. If you need assistance, give us names, and we shall also wake as many of your subordinates and colleagues as you may require."<BR><BR>Felless tried to lever herself off the table on which she lay. Straps restrained her: a sensible precaution on the physician's part. As she fumbled with the catches, she asked, "How much more advanced were they than we expected? Enough to make the conquest significantly harder, I gather."<BR><BR>"Indeed." Reffet added an emphatic cough. "When the conquest fleet arrived, they were engaged in active research on jet aircraft, on guided missiles, and on nuclear fission."<BR><BR>"That is impossible!" Felless blurted. Then, realizing what she'd said, she added, "I beg the Exalted Fleetlord's pardon."<BR><BR>"Senior Researcher, I freely give it to you," Reffet replied. "When the colonization fleet began receiving data from Tosev 3, my first belief was that Atvar, the fleetlord on the conquest fleet, was playing an elaborate joke on us-jerking our tailstumps, as the saying has it. I have since been disabused of this belief. I wish I had not been, for it strikes me as far more palatable than the truth."<BR><BR>"But-But-" Felless knew she was stuttering, and made herself pause to gather her thoughts. "If that is true, Exalted Fleetlord, I count it something of a marvel that ... that the conquest did not fail." Such a thought would have been unimaginable back on Home. It should have been unimaginable here, too. That she'd imagined it proved it wasn't.<BR><BR>Reffet said, "In part, Senior Researcher, the conquest did fail. There are still unsubdued Tosevite empires-actually, the term the conquest fleet consistently uses is not-empires, which I do not altogether understand-on the surface of Tosev 3, along with areas the Race has in fact conquered. Nor have the Tosevites ceased their technical progress in the eyeblink of time since the conquest fleet arrived. I am warned that only a threat of retaliatory violence from the conquest fleet has kept them from mounting attacks on this colonization fleet."<BR><BR>Felless felt far dizzier than she would have from weightlessness and sudden revival from cold sleep alone. She finally managed to free herself from the restraining straps and gently push off from the table. "Take me to a terminal at once, if you would be so kind. Have you an edited summary of the data thus far transmitted from the conquest fleet?"<BR><BR>"We have," Reffet said. "I hope you will find it adequate, Senior Researcher. It was prepared by fleet officers who are not specialists in your area of expertise. We have, of course, provided links to the fuller documentation sent up from Tosev 3."<BR><BR>"If you will come with me, superior female ..." the physician said. She swung rapidly from one handhold to another. Felless followed.<BR><BR>She had to strap herself into the chair in front of the terminal to keep the ventilating current from blowing her off it. Getting back to work felt good. She wished she could have waited till reaching the surface of Tosev 3 for reawakening; that would have been as planned back on Home, and plans were made to be followed. But she would do the best she could here.<BR><BR>And, as she called up the summary, a curious blend of anticipation and dread coursed through her. Wild Tosevites ... What would dealing with wild Tosevites be like? She'd expected the locals to be well on their way toward assimilation into the Empire by now. Even then, they would have been different from the Hallessi and the Rabotevs, who but for their looks were as much subjects of the Emperor (even thinking of her sovereign made Felless cast down her eyes) as were the males and females of the Race.<BR><BR>A male in body paint like Reffet's appeared on the screen in front of her. "Welcome to Tosev 3," he said in tones anything but welcoming. "This is a world of paradox. If you were expecting anything here to be as it was back on Home, you will be disappointed. You may very well be dead. The only thing you may safely expect on Tosev 3 is the unexpected. I daresay you who listen to this will not believe me. Were I new-come from Home, I would not believe such words, either. Before rejecting them out of claw, examine the evidence."<BR><BR>A slowly spinning globe of Tosev 3 appeared on the screen. Something over half the land area was red, the rest a variety of other colors. The red, the legend by the globe explained, showed that area of the planet the Race controlled. The other colors, which dominated the northern hemisphere, showed areas where the natives still ruled themselves.<BR><BR>After Felless had just long enough to soak in the significance of that, the colors faded, leaving the land areas in more or less their natural colors. Glowing dots, some red, some blue, appeared here and there. "Red dots show nuclear weapons detonated by the Race, blue dots those detonated by the Tosevites," a voice said.<BR><BR>Felless let out a slow, horrified hiss. About as many dots glowed blue as red. Atvar's head and torso reappeared on the screen. "Judging that continuing the war for total conquest might well render this planet useless to the colonization fleet, we entered into negotiations with the Tosevite not-empires possessing nuclear weapons, conceding their independence in exchange for a cessation of hostilities," the leader of the conquest fleet said. "On the whole-there have been certain unpleasant exceptions-peace between the Race and the Tosevites and among the Tosevite factions has prevailed for the past thirty-four years-seventeen of this planet's revolutions, which are just over twice as long as ours. I freely admit it is not the sort of peace I would have desired. There were, however, many times when I thought it was more than I would ever get. See for yourself what we faced even at the beginning of our struggle against the Tosevites."<BR><BR>His image faded, to be replaced by those of landcruisers of obviously alien manufacture. The tracked and armored fortresses were not a match for those of the Race, but the barbarous inhabitants of Tosev 3, by everything Felless knew, should not have been able to build landcruisers at all.<BR><BR>"Three years later, we were facing these," Atvar said.<BR><BR>New landcruisers replaced those formerly on the screen. They looked more formidable. Their specifications said they were more formidable. They carried more armor and bigger guns and had more powerful engines. They still didn't match the machines the Race used, but they were getting closer.<BR><BR>"Three years," Felless said in almost disbelieving wonder-one and a half of Tosev 3's years. The later-model landcruisers looked to be separated from the earlier ones by a couple of hundred years of slow development. On Home, they would have been.<BR><BR>Tosevite aircraft showed the same astonishing leap in technical prowess. The natives had gone from machines propelled by rotating airfoils to jets and rocket-powered killercraft in wh<BR><BR>"How?" Felless murmured. "How could they have done such a thing?"<BR><BR>As if answering her, Atvar said, "Explanations for the Tosevites' extraordinary proficiency fall into two main areas, which may or may not be mutually exclusive: the geographical and the biological. Oceans and mountains break up Tosevite land masses in ways unknown on other worlds of the Empire, fostering the formation of small, competitive groups." The globe reappeared, this time splotched in ways that struck Felless as absurdly complex. "These were the political divisions on Tosev 3 at the time the conquest fleet arrived."<BR><BR>Atvar continued, "Reproductive biology among the Tosevites is unlike that of any other intelligent race we know, and has profound effects on their society. Females are, or can be, continually receptive; males are, or can be, continually active. This leads to pair-bondings and ..." He went on for some time.<BR><BR>Long before he'd finished, Felless hissed out a single word: "Disgusting." She wondered how so aberrant a species had ever developed intelligence, let alone a technology that let it challenge the Race.<BR><BR>At last, and very much to her relief, the fleetlord of the conquest fleet chose another topic. She listened until Atvar finished, "This conquest, if it is to be accomplished, will be a matter for generations, not days as was anticipated when we left Home. The landing of the colonization fleet and settlement of the colonists will greatly aid in integrating the independent not-empires into the larger structure of the Empire. Exposure to proper examples cannot help but lead the Big Uglies"-by then, Felless had gathered that was the conquest fleet's nickname for the Tosevites-"to emulate the high example that will be placed before them." His image vanished from the screen.<BR><BR>Felless turned to Reffet. "You were right to rouse me, Exalted Fleetlord. This will be a more challenging problem than anyone could have anticipated-and, no doubt, the conquest fleet has made its share of mistakes in dealing with these bizarre Tosevites." She let out a hissing sigh. "I can see I shall have my work cut out for me."<BR><BR>Without false modesty, Vyacheslav Molotov knew himself to be one of the three most powerful men on the face of the Earth. Without false self-aggrandizement, he knew Atvar, the Lizards' fleetlord, was more powerful than he or Heinrich Himmler or Earl Warren. What had not been obvious over the past two crowded decades was whether Atvar was more powerful than the leaders of the USSR, the Greater German Reich, and the USA put together.<BR><BR>But soon, very soon, the Lizards' colonization fleet would bring millions more of their kind, males and females both, to Earth. Even though the fleet was entirely civilian-the Lizards had not anticipated needing more military help when it left their home world-it would tilt the scales in their direction. It could hardly do anything else.<BR><BR>As he sat in his Kremlin office, Molotov did not show what he was thinking. He had reached the top of the Soviet hierarchy, succeeding Iosef Stalin as general secretary of the Communist Party, not least by never showing what he was thinking. His stone face-poker face was the American idiom, which he rather liked-had also served him well in dealing with foreigners and with the Lizards.<BR><BR>His own secretary stuck his head into the office. "Comrade General Secretary, the foreign commissar has arrived."<BR><BR>"Very well, Pyotr Maksimovich, send him in," Molotov answered. He glanced at his wristwatch as the secretary disappeared. Ten o'clock on the dot. Since no one could see him do it, Molotov nodded approval. Some people understood the virtue of punctuality, however un-Russian it was.<BR><BR>In strode Andrei Gromyko. "Good day, Vyacheslav Mikhailovich," he said, extending his hand.<BR><BR>Molotov shook it. "And to you, Andrei Andreyevich," he said, and gestured to the chair across the desk from his own. "Sit down." Without any further small talk, Gromyko did. Molotov thought well of the foreign commissar not least because his craggy countenance revealed almost as little as Molotov's own.<BR><BR>Gromyko went straight to business, another trait of which Molotov approved: "Is there any change in our position of which I should be aware before we meet with the Lizards' ambassador to the Soviet Union?"<BR><BR>"I do not believe so, no," Molotov replied. "We remain strongly opposed to their settling colonists in Persia or Afghanistan or Kashmir or any other land near our borders."<BR><BR>One of Gromyko's shaggy eyebrows twitched. "Any other, Vyacheslav Mikhailovich?" he asked.<BR><BR>Molotov grunted. Gromyko had caught him fair and square. "You are correct, of course. We have no objection whatever to their colonization of Poland, however extensive that may prove."<BR><BR>While withdrawing from most of their European conquests, the Lizards had stayed in Poland: neither Germany nor the USSR was willing to see it in the other's hands, and neither was willing to see a Polish state revive. With the Lizards administering the area, it made a splendid buffer between the Soviet Union and Nazi-dominated Western Europe. Molotov was delighted to have the Lizards there. He feared the Greater German Reich, and hoped with all his heart that Himmler likewise feared the USSR.<BR><BR>Gromyko said, "I remind you, Comrade General Secretary, that the Lizards have consistently maintained we have no right to dictate to them where they may settle on territory they rule."<BR><BR>"We are not dictating. We are not in a position to dictate, however unfortunate that may be," Molotov said. "We are making our views known to them. We are in a position to do that. If they choose to ignore us, they show themselves to be uncultured and give us grounds for ignoring them in appropriate circumstances."<BR><BR>"They are of the opinion-the strong opinion-that we ignore their views by continuing to supply weapons to progressive forces in China and Afghanistan," Gromyko said.<BR><BR>"I cannot imagine why they continue to hold such an opinion," Molotov said. "We have repeatedly denied any such involvement."<BR><BR>Gromyko did own an impressive stone face, for he failed to crack a smile at that. So did Molotov. Here as so often, denials and truth bore little relation to each other. But the Lizards had never quite been able to prove Soviet denials were false, and so the denials continued.<BR><BR>"A thought," Gromyko said, raising a forefinger.<BR><BR>"Go on." Molotov nodded. His neck creaked a little as he did so. He was up past seventy, his face more wrinkled than it had been when the Lizards first came to Earth, his hair thinner and almost entirely gray. Aging mattered relatively little to him; he had never been a man who relied on creating an overwhelming physical impression.<BR><BR>Gromyko said, "Should the Yashcheritsi offer not to settle heavily along our southern border if we truly do stop arms shipments that annoy them, how ought we to respond?"<BR><BR>"Ah. That is interesting, Andrei Andreyevich," Molotov said. "Do you think they would have the imagination to propose such a bargain?" Before Gromyko could answer, Molotov went on, "If they do not, should we propose it to them?" Now he did smile, unpleasantly. "How Mao would howl!"<BR><BR>"So he would. Seldom have I met a man who had so much arrogance," Gromyko said. "Hitler came close, but Hitler actually led a state, where Mao has spent the last thirty years wishing he could."<BR><BR>"Even so," Molotov agreed. He pondered. Would he sell his Chinese ideological brethren down the river to gain advantage for the Soviet Union? He did not need to ponder long. "I hope Queek does propose it; if we do so, it may suggest weakness to the Lizards. But we can raise the issue if we must. Keeping the Lizards well away from us counts for more than keeping Mao happy."<BR><BR>"I agree, Comrade General Secretary," Gromyko said. "The Lizards will not settle China in any great numbers; it already has too many people. Mao's chief value to us is keeping the countryside unsettled, and he will do that with or without our arms."<BR><BR>"A very pretty solution indeed," Molotov said, warming up all the way to tepid. "One way or another, we shall use it."<BR><BR>Molotov's secretary came in and announced, "The ambassador from the Race and his interpreter are here." He did not call the Lizard a Lizard, not where the said Lizard or the interpreter could hear him.<BR><BR>Queek skittered into Molotov's office. He was about the size of a ten-year-old, though he seemed smaller because of his forward-slung posture. One of his eye turrets, weirdly like a chameleon's, swiveled toward Molotov, the other toward Gromyko. Molotov could not read his body paint, but its ornateness declared his high rank.<BR><BR>He addressed Molotov and Gromyko in his own hissing language. The interpreter, a tall, stolid, middle-aged human, spoke good Russian with a Polish accent: "The ambassador greets you in the name of the Emperor."<BR><BR>"Tell him that we greet him in return, in the name of the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union," Molotov answered. He smiled again, down where it did not show. At his very first meeting with the Lizards, not long after their invasion, he'd had the pleasure of letting them know that the Soviets had liquidated the Tsar and his family. Their own Emperors had ruled them for fifty thousands years; the news taught them, better then anything else could have done, that they were not dealing with creatures of a familiar sort.<BR><BR>The interpreter hissed and squeaked and popped and coughed. Queek made similar appalling noises. Again, the interpreter translated: "The ambassador says he is not certain this meeting has any point, as he has already made it clear to the foreign commissar that your views on the settlement of the Race are unacceptable."<BR><BR>Even more than the Nazis, the Lizards were convinced they were the lords of creation and everyone else their natural subjects. As he had almost twenty years before, Molotov took pleasure in reminding them they might be wrong: "If we are sufficiently provoked, we will attack the colonization fleet in space."<BR><BR>"If we are sufficiently provoked, we will serve the present rulers of the Soviet Union as you butchers served your Emperor," Queek retorted. The interpreter looked as if he enjoyed translating the Lizard's reply; Molotov wondered what grievance he held against the Soviet Union.<BR><BR>No time to worry about that now. Molotov said, "Whatever sacrifices are required of us, we shall make them."<BR><BR>He wondered how true that was. It had certainly been true a generation before, with the Soviet people mobilized to battle first the Nazis and then the Lizards. Now, after a time of comfort, who could be sure if it still was? But the Lizards might not-he hoped they did not-know that.<BR><BR>Queek said, "Even after so long, I cannot understand how you Tosevites can be such madmen. You are willing to destroy yourselves, so long as you can also harm your foes."<BR><BR>"This often makes our foes less eager to attack us," Andrei Gromyko pointed out. "Sometimes we must convince people we mean what we say. Your taste for aggression, for instance, is less than it was before you encountered the determination of the Soviet people."<BR><BR>By studying motion pictures of prisoners, Molotov had gained a good working knowledge of what Lizards' gestures and motions meant. Gromyko had succeeded in alarming Queek. Molotov added, "If you expect to get good treatment from us, you must show us good treatment in return."<BR><BR>That was a lesson the Lizards had had a hard time learning. It was also an invitation to dicker. Would Queek see as much? Molotov wasn't sure. The Lizards were better diplomats now than they had been when they first came-they had more practice at the art, too. They weren't stupid. Anyone who thought otherwise quickly paid the price. But they were naive, even more naive than Americans.<BR><BR>"The converse should also apply," Queek said. "Why should we even deal with you, when you keep sending weapons to those who would overthrow our rule?"<BR><BR>"We deny this," Molotov said automatically. But did Queek offer an opening? Molotov was willing to trade hint for hint: "Why should we trust you, when you plainly plan on packing the borders with your kind?"<BR><BR>Queek paused before replying. Was he also trying to decide whether he heard the beginnings of a deal? At last, he said, "We should have less need to rely on the Race's military might if you did not keep provoking your surrogates against us with hopes of a triumph surely impossible."<BR><BR>"Have you not seen, Ambassador, how little is impossible on this world?" Molotov said.<BR><BR>"We have seen this, yes: seen it to our sorrow," Queek replied. "Were it not so, I would not be here negotiating with you. But since I am, perhaps we can discuss this matter further."<BR><BR>"Perhaps we can," Molotov said. "I have doubts as to whether it will come to anything, but perhaps we can." He watched Queek lean forward slightly. Yes, the Lizard was serious. Molotov did not smile. Getting down to business was a capitalist phrase, but in the privacy of his own mind he used it anyway.<BR><BR>Ttomalss politely inclined his head. "It is a pleasure to see a new face from Home, superior female," he said to the researcher from the colonization fleet who had come to consult with him. On the whole, he was telling the truth; he had not always got on well with the colleagues who had accompanied him in the colonization fleet, or with the Big Uglies he studied.<BR><BR>"In this matter, I should call you 'superior sir,'" the newcomer-her name was Felless-replied. "You have the expertise. You have the experience with these Tosevites."<BR><BR>More than I ever wanted, Ttomalss thought, remembering captivity in China he'd expected to lead to his death. Aloud, he said, "You are gracious," which was also true, for Felless' body paint showed that she outranked him.<BR><BR>"You have had all the time since the arrival of the conquest fleet to assimilate the implausible nature of the natives of Tosev 3," Felless said. "To me, having to try to understand it in a matter of days-a most hasty and inefficient procedure-it seems not merely implausible but impossible."<BR><BR>"This was our reaction on reaching this world, too," Ttomalss said. "We have since had to adapt to changing conditions." He let his mouth fall open. "Anyone on Tosev 3 who fails to adapt is ruined. We have seen that demonstrated-and most often painfully demonstrated-time and again."<BR><BR>"So I gather," Felless said. "It must have been very difficult for you. Change, after all, is an unnatural condition."<BR><BR>"So I thought before leaving Home," Ttomalss replied. "So I still think, at times, for so I was trained to think all my life. But, had we not changed, the best we could have done would have been to destroy this planet-and where would that have left you and the colonization fleet, superior female?"<BR><BR>Felless did not take him seriously. He could tell at a glance; he barely needed one eye turret to see it, let alone two. That saddened him, but hardly surprised him. She had the beginnings of an intellectual understanding of what the Race had been through on Tosev 3. Ttomalss had been through every bit of it. The scars still marked his spirit. It would never be free of them till it met the spirits of Emperors past face to face.<BR><BR>"You are to be commended for your diligent efforts to gain understanding of the roots of Tosevite behavior," Felless said.<BR><BR>"Nice to know someone thinks so," Ttomalss said, remembering quarrels down through the years. "Some males, I think, would sooner stay ignorant. And some would sooner put their tongues in a ginger jar and forget their research and everything else."<BR><BR>He waited. Sure enough, Felless asked a hesitant question: "Ginger? I have seen the name in the reports. It must refer to a drug native to Tosev 3, for it is certainly unknown back on Home."<BR><BR>"That's right. It's an herb that grows here," Ttomalss said. "For the natives, it is just a spice, the way balj is back on Home. It is a drug for us, though, and a nasty one. It makes a male feel smart and bold and strong-and when it wears off, it makes him feel like having some more. Once it gets its claws in you, you will do almost anything for another taste."<BR><BR>"With more enforcement personnel here now, we should be able to root it out without much trouble," Felless said.<BR><BR>Ttomalss remembered that pristine confidence, that sense that things would keep going smoothly because they always had. He'd known it himself. Then he'd started dealing with the Big Uglies. Like so many males on Tosev 3, he'd lost it and never got it back. He didn't try to explain that to Felless. The female would find out for herself.<BR><BR>"Why would anyone want a drug in the first place, especially an alien drug?" Felless asked him.<BR><BR>"At first because you're bored, or else because you see someone else having a good time and you want one, too," he answered. "We shall have trouble with ginger when the colonists land, mark my words."<BR><BR>"I shall record your prediction," Felless said. "I tend to doubt its accuracy, but, as I said, you are the one with experience on Tosev 3, so perhaps you will prove correct in the end."<BR><BR>Was she so serious all the time? A lot of people back on Home were. Ttomalss remembered as much. Contact with the Big Uglies-even contact with males who had contact with the Big Uglies-had a way of abrading such seriousness. And now a hundred million colonists, once revived, would look on the relative handful of males from the colonization fleet as slightly addled eggs. Ttomalss didn't see what anyone could do about that, either.<BR><BR>Deep inside, he laughed to himself. Eventually, the colonists would have to start dealing with the Tosevites. Then they'd start getting addled, too. In spite of his best efforts to believe otherwise, Ttomalss could reach no other conclusion. Even if Tosev 3 at last came completely under the Emperor's rule, it would be the odd world out in more ways than one for years, centuries, millennia to come.<BR><BR>Because he'd been mentally picking parasites out from under his scales, he missed a comment from Felless. "I am sorry, superior female?" he said, embarrassed.<BR><BR>"I said that, of all the researchers with the conquest fleet, you seem to have gone furthest in your efforts to examine the integration of Tosevites and the Race." Felless repeated the compliment with no sign of exasperation. She continued, "Some of your activities strike me as going above and beyond the call of duty."<BR><BR>"You are generous, superior female," Ttomalss said. "My view has always been that, if this world is to be successfully colonized, effecting such integration will be mandatory."<BR><BR>"You doubt the possibility of successful colonization?" Now Felless sounded reproving, not complimentary.<BR><BR>"I doubt the certainty of successful colonization," Ttomalss replied. "Anyone with experience of Tosev 3 doubts the certainly of anything pertaining to it."<BR><BR>"And yet you have persisted," Felless said. "In your reports, you indicate that your first experimental specimen was forcibly taken away from you, and that you yourself were kidnapped by Tosevite bandits while seeking to obtain a replacement for it."<BR><BR>"Truth," Ttomalss said. "We badly underestimated the importance of family bonds on Tosev 3, due not only to long-term sexual pairings but also to the absurdly helpless nature of Tosevite hatchlings, which need constant care if they are to survive. Because of these factors, my experiments have met with far more opposition from the Big Uglies than they would have from any other intelligent race with which we are familiar."<BR><BR>"And yet, in the end, your work seems to have met with success," Felless said. "I wonder if you would be so kind as to allow me to make the acquaintance of the specimen you finally succeeded in obtaining and rearing."<BR><BR>"I thought you might ask that." Ttomalss rose. "Kassquit is waiting in the next chamber. I shall return in a moment."<BR><BR>"My first Tosevite, even if not quite a wild specimen," Felless said in musing tones. "How interesting this will be!"<BR><BR>"Please do your best to treat the Big Ugly as you would a member of the Race," Ttomalss warned. "Since the Tosevite gained speech-which Big Uglies do more quickly than our own hatchlings-all males have followed this course, which appears to have worked well."<BR><BR>"It shall be done," Felless promised.<BR><BR>Ttomalss went into the adjacent chamber, where Kassquit sat in front of a screen, engrossed in a game. "The researcher from Home wishes to speak with you," Ttomalss said.<BR><BR>"It shall be done, superior sir," Kassquit said obediently, and got up. The Big Ugly, though not large for a Tosevite, stood head and neck above Ttomalss. Kassquit followed him back to the chamber where Felless waited. Bending into the posture of respect, the Tosevite said to her, "I greet you, superior sir."<BR><BR>"Superior female," Ttomalss corrected. He turned to Felless. "You are the first female Kassquit has met."<BR><BR>"I am very pleased to make your acquaintance, Kassquit," Felless said.<BR><BR>"I thank you, superior female." Kassquit used the correct title this time. The Big Ugly's voice was slightly mushy; Tosevite mouthparts could not quite handle all the sounds of the language of the Race. "You are truly from Home?"<BR><BR>"I am," Felless said.<BR><BR>"I would like to visit Home," Kassquit said wistfully, "but cold sleep has not yet been adapted to my biochemistry."<BR><BR>"Perhaps it will be one day," Felless said. Ttomalss watched her try to hide surprise; Kassquit was young, but far from stupid. Felless went on, "Rabotevs and Hallessi travel between the stars-no reason Tosevites should not as well."<BR><BR>"I hope you are right, superior female." Kassquit turned small, immobile eyes toward Ttomalss. "May I be excused, superior sir?"<BR><BR>Was that shyness or a desire to return to the game? Whatever it was, Ttomalss yielded to it: "You may."<BR><BR>"I thank you, superior sir. I am glad to have met you, superior female." After another respectful bend, Kassquit left, tall and ridiculously erect.<BR><BR>"Brighter than I expected," Felless remarked once the Big Ugly was gone. "Less alien-seeming, too; far less so than the Tosevites in the images I have seen."<BR><BR>"That is by design, to aid in integration," Ttomalss said. "The body paint, of course, designates Kassquit as my apprentice. The unsightly hair at the top of the Tosevite's head is frequently clipped to the skin. When Kassquit reached sexual maturity, more hair grew at the armpits and around the genital area, though Kassquit's race is less hairy than most Tosevites."<BR><BR>"What is the function of these hairy patches that emerge at sexual maturity?" Felless asked. "I presume they pertain to reproduction in some way."<BR><BR>"That is not yet fully understood," Ttomalss admitted. "They may help spread pheromones from odorous glands in these areas, but Tosevite reproductive behavior is less closely tied to odor cues than our own."<BR><BR>"Are these creatures truly accessible to one another at all seasons?" Felless asked. A wriggle said what she thought of the idea.<BR><BR>But Ttomalss had to answer, "Truly. And they find our way as strange and repugnant as we find theirs. I confess that, despite my scientific objectivity, I have a great deal of trouble grasping this. Surely our way is far more convenient. You are not in season; my scent receptors know as much; and so you are simply a colleague. No complications involved with mating need arise."<BR><BR>"And a good thing, too," Felless exclaimed. She and Ttomalss both laughed at the absurdities of the Big Uglies.

All rights reserved.<BR>Chapter 1<BR><BR>Atvar, the fleetlord of the Race's conquest fleet, and Reffet, the<BR>fleetlord of the colonization fleet, were having a disagreement. They<BR>had agreed on very little since Reffet brought the colonization fleet to<BR>Tosev 3. Atvar was convinced Reffet still had no real understanding of<BR>the way things worked on this miserable planet. He didn't know what<BR>Reffet was convinced of--probably that things on Tosev 3 were in fact<BR>the way the Race had fondly imagined them to be before sending out the<BR>conquest fleet. "I do not know what you wish me to do, Reffet," he said.<BR>They were equals; neither of them was Exalted Fleetlord to the other.<BR>They could be, and often were, equally impolite to each other. "No<BR>matter what you may believe, I cannot work miracles." He swiveled his<BR>eye turrets this way and that to show exasperation.<BR><BR>Reffet swiveled his eye turrets, too, and hissed for good measure. "I do<BR>not see that it is so difficult. The ship the Big Uglies have launched<BR>is under very low acceleration. You have plenty of time to send a<BR>reconnaissance probe after it and keep it under close, secret<BR>observation."<BR><BR>"And you brought starships across the light-years between Home and<BR>here!" Atvar exclaimed. "You must have had good officers and good<BR>computers, for you surely were not up to the job unaided." He paced<BR>across his office, which had been a suite in Shepheard's Hotel before<BR>the Race occupied Cairo. It gave him plenty of room to pace; Tosevites<BR>were larger than males and females of the Race, and, naturally, built in<BR>proportion to their own size.<BR><BR>"Leave off your insults," Reffet replied with another hiss, an angry<BR>one. His tailstump switched back and forth, back and forth. "I repeat, I<BR>do not see that what I have asked is so very difficult. As I said, that<BR>ship, that Clewis and Lark, is under acceleration of no more than a<BR>hundredth of the force of gravity."<BR><BR>"Lewis and Clark." Atvar took no small relish in correcting his<BR>colleague and rival over even minute details that shouldn't have<BR>mattered to anyone save a Big Ugly. "That it is under tiny acceleration<BR>does not matter. That it is under continuous acceleration does. If we<BR>are to observe it closely and continually, our reconnaissance must be<BR>under acceleration, too. And how, I ask, do you propose to keep that<BR>secret? A spacecraft with a working engine is by the nature of things<BR>anything but secret."<BR><BR>"By the Emperor!" Reffet burst out. He lowered his eyes to the floor<BR>when naming his sovereign. So did Atvar, on hearing the title. From<BR>training since hatchlinghood, any member of the Race would have done the<BR>same. Still furious, Reffet went on, "These accursed Tosevites have no<BR>business flying in space." He used an emphatic cough to underline his<BR>words. "They have no business having instruments that let them detect<BR>what we do when we fly in space, either."<BR><BR>Atvar let his mouth fall open in amusement. "Come here, Reffet," he<BR>said, walking over to the window. "Come here--it is safe enough. I<BR>intend no tricks, and the riots seem to have quieted down again, so no<BR>Big Ugly is likely to be aiming a sniper's rifle in this direction at<BR>the moment. I want to show you something."<BR><BR>Suspicion manifest in every line of his forward-sloping body, Reffet<BR>came. "What is it?" The suspicion filled his voice, too.<BR><BR>"There." Atvar pointed west across the great river that flowed past<BR>Cairo. "Do you see those three stone pyramids, there in the sand?"<BR><BR>Reffet deigned to turn one eye turret in that direction. "I see them.<BR>What of it? They look massive, but weathered and primitive."<BR><BR>"They are primitive--that is my point," Atvar said. "They are as old as<BR>any monuments on this world. They were built as memorials to local<BR>rulers eight thousand years ago, more or less: eight thousand of our<BR>years--half that many for the years of Tosev 3. Eight thousand years<BR>ago, we had already had a planet- wide Empire for more than ninety<BR>thousand years. We had already conquered the Rabotevs. We had already<BR>conquered the Hallessi. We were beginning to wonder if the star<BR>Tosev--this world's star--had any interesting planets. Here,<BR>civilization was just hatching from its egg."<BR><BR>"And it should have taken much longer to hatch, too," Reffet said<BR>irritably. "The Big Uglies should still be building monuments much like<BR>these, as we were not long after we started gathering in cities."<BR><BR>"Truth." Atvar's voice was sad. "They should have. In fact, we thought<BR>they had. You will have seen this picture of a Tosevite warrior in full<BR>battle regalia before you set out from Home, of course."<BR><BR>He walked over to the hologram projector and called up an image. He had<BR>seen it countless times himself, both before reaching Tosev 3 and since.<BR>It showed a hairy Big Ugly in rusty chainmail, armed with sword and<BR>spear and iron-faced wooden shield and riding a four-legged beast with a<BR>long head, an unkempt mane, and a shaggy tail.<BR><BR>"Yes, of course I have seen that image," Reffet said. "It is one of<BR>those our probe took sixteen hundred years ago. From it, we assumed the<BR>conquest would be easy."<BR><BR>"So we did," Atvar agreed. "But the point is, in those intervening<BR>sixteen hundred years--eight hundred of this planet's revolutions--the<BR>Tosevites somehow developed industrial civilization. However much you<BR>and I and every other member of the Race may wish they had remained<BR>primitive, the sorry fact is that they did not. We have to deal with<BR>that fact now."<BR><BR>"It was not planned thus." Reffet made that an accusation. The Race<BR>moved by plans, by tiny incremental steps. Anything different came hard.<BR><BR>Atvar had been dealing with the Big Uglies for more than forty of his<BR>years. By painful necessity, he'd begun to adapt to the hectic pace of<BR>Tosev 3. "Whether it was planned or not, it is so. You cannot crawl back<BR>into your eggshell and deny it."<BR><BR>Reffet wanted to deny it. Again, every line of his body showed as much.<BR>So did the big breath of air he sucked deep into his lung. "I think I<BR>would rather deal with the Tosevites than with you," he snarled. "I know<BR>they are aliens. With you, I cannot tell whether you have become half<BR>alien or are simply addled like an egg gone bad."<BR><BR>That did it. Atvar drew in a deep, angry breath of his own. It brought<BR>the stinks of Cairo--the stinks of Big Uglies and of their food and<BR>their wastes, as well as the stinks from the hydrocarbon-burning engines<BR>they had developed themselves--across the scent receptors in his tongue.<BR>"Go away," he told Reffet, and added an emphatic cough of his own. "I<BR>have not the time to deal with your stupidity. Whatever the Big Uglies<BR>in that spacecraft do, they will not do it soon. I am facing a serious<BR>uprising in the subregion of the main continental mass called China. I<BR>have to deal with that now. I will deal with the American spacecraft as<BR>I find the chance, or when it becomes urgent. Meanwhile, good day."<BR><BR>"You have turned into a Big Ugly," Reffet said furiously. "All you care<BR>about is the immediate. Anything that requires forethought is beyond<BR>you."<BR><BR>"Tosev 3 will do that to a male--unless it kills him first," Atvar<BR>answered. Then he paused. Both his eye turrets swung thoughtfully toward<BR>Reffet. "Have you any notion how many casualties the Big Uglies'<BR>continual revolts have cost us?"<BR><BR>"No, I do not." Reffet sounded peevish. As far as Atvar was concerned,<BR>Reffet sounded peevish far too often. The fleetlord of the colonization<BR>fleet went on, "Had you done a proper job of conquering this planet, I<BR>would not have to concern myself with such things--and neither would<BR>you."<BR><BR>I will not bite him, Atvar thought. I will not tear his belly open with<BR>my fingerclaws. But he hadn't known such temptation to pure, cleansing<BR>violence since a ginger-induced mating frenzy in Australia. Fortunately,<BR>he had no ginger coursing through him now, nor could he smell any<BR>females pheromones. That let him stay his usual rational self. "Deal<BR>with things here as they are, Reffet," he said, "not as you wish they<BR>would be. Our casualties have been heavy, far heavier than anyone could<BR>possibly have anticipated before we left Home. Like it or not, that is a<BR>truth."<BR><BR>"Very well. That is a truth." Reffet still sounded peevish. "I do not<BR>see how it is a truth to concern me, however. I am in charge of<BR>colonists, not soldiers."<BR><BR>"All you care about is the immediate," Atvar said, waggling his jaw as<BR>he dropped it to turn his laugh nasty. He took malicious pleasure in<BR>bouncing the other fleetlord's words off his snout. "Anything that<BR>requires forethought is beyond you."<BR><BR>"Very well." Now Reffet sounded condescending. "What fresh nonsense is<BR>this?"<BR><BR>"It is no nonsense at all, but something we would have had to face<BR>sooner or later during our occupation of Tosev 3," Atvar answered. "It<BR>might as well be now. Have you noticed that this is a world consumed by<BR>war and rebellion, that the Big Uglies in the regions we occupy<BR>continually try to overthrow our rule, and that the Tosevites'<BR>independent not-empires--the SSSR, the Greater German Reich, the United<BR>States, and also the weaker ones like Nippon and Britain--train large<BR>numbers of their inhabitants as soldiers year after year?"<BR><BR>"I have noticed it," Reffet admitted, "but you are the fleetlord of the<BR>conquest fleet. Soldiers are your responsibility."<BR><BR>"Truth," Atvar said. "They are. This is not Home, where, save in a<BR>Soldiers' Time of preparation for conquest, we have no soldiers, only<BR>police. Here, we will need soldiers continuously, for hundreds of years<BR>to come. Where shall we get them, if we do not begin the training of<BR>males, and possibly females as well, from among your precious<BR>colonists?"<BR><BR>"What?" Reffet cried. "This is madness! It is nothing but madness! My<BR>colonists are colonists. How can they become fighters?"<BR><BR>"The males I command managed," Atvar said. "I am certain I can recruit<BR>trainers from among them. Think, Reffet." He didn't bother being<BR>sardonic, not any more; the more he thought on this, the more important<BR>it looked. "How long can the Race endure here on Tosev 3 without<BR>soldiers to defend us?"<BR><BR>Reffet did think. Reluctantly, Atvar gave him credit for it. After a<BR>pause, the fleetlord of the colonization fleet said, "It could be that<BR>you are correct. I shall not commit myself further than that without<BR>analysis from my experts. If you would also convene a panel of your<BR>experts to examine the issue, I should be grateful."<BR><BR>With any other member of the Race on or near Tosev 3, Ref- fet could<BR>have given an order and heard It shall be done as reply. Having to make<BR>a polite request of Atvar surely grated on him. Atvar knew having to<BR>make a request of Reffet grated on him. Here, the request was nothing if<BR>not reasonable. "I will do that, and soon," Atvar promised. "It is<BR>something we need to examine, as I said."<BR><BR>"So it is." Like Atvar's, Reffet's temper seemed to be cooling. He said,<BR>"If it proves we must do this thing, it will make us different from the<BR>members of the Race back on Home and inhabiting Rabotev 2 and Halless<BR>1."<BR><BR>"Males of the conquest fleet are already different from all other<BR>members of the Race," Atvar replied. "My hope is that, over the course<BR>of hundreds of years, we will gradually incorporate all the Big Uglies<BR>into the Empire and assimilate them to our way of doing things. If we<BR>succeed there, the differences between those of the Race here on Tosev 3<BR>and those living on the other worlds of the Empire will gradually<BR>disappear."<BR><BR>"By the Emperor, may it be so," Reffet said. He and Atvar cast down<BR>their eyes again. Then, half talking to himself, Reffet went on, "But<BR>what if it is not so?"<BR><BR>"That is my nightmare," Atvar told him. "That has been my nightmare<BR>since we first discovered the Big Uglies' true nature. They change<BR>faster than we do. They grow faster than we do. They are still behind<BR>us, but not by so much as they were when we came to Tosev 3. If they, or<BR>some of them, remain hostile, if they look like they are passing us . .<BR>." His voice trailed away.<BR><BR>"Yes?" Reffet prompted. "What then?"<BR><BR>"We may have to destroy this world, and our own colony on it," Atvar<BR>answered unhappily. "We may have to destroy ourselves, to save the<BR>Race."<BR><BR>Under an acceleration of .01g, Lieutenant Colonel Glen Johnson had to<BR>wear a seat belt to stay in his chair. His effective weight was just<BR>over a pound and a half--not enough for muscles used to Earth's robust<BR>gravity to notice. Any fidgeting at all would have sent him bouncing<BR>around the Lewis and Clark's control room. Bouncing around in a room<BR>full of instruments wasn't recommended.<BR><BR>He turned to Colonel Walter Stone, the American spaceship's chief pilot.<BR>"This is the best seat in the house," he said.<BR><BR>"You'd best believe it, Johnson," Stone answered. The two of them might<BR>have been cousins: they were both lean, athletic men in their early<BR>middle years; both crew cut; both, by coincidence, from Ohio. Johnson<BR>had started in the Marines, Stone in the Army Air Corps. Each looked<BR>down his nose at the other because of that.

The definitive "Customer Success Manager How-To-Guide" for the CSM profession from Gainsight, who brought you the market-leading Customer Success<BR><BR>The Customer Success Manager has become a critical asset to organizations across the business landscape. As the subscription model has spread from the cloud and SaaS to more sectors of the economy, that pivotal role will only grow in importance. That's because if you want to compete and thrive in this new environment, you need to put the customer at the center of your strategy. You need to recognize you're no longer selling just a product. You're selling an outcome. Customer Success Managers (CSM) are committed to capturing and delivering those outcomes by listening to their customers, understanding their needs, and adapting products and services to drive success. Although several existing resources address the customer success imperative, there is no authoritative instruction manual for the CSM professionâuntil now.<BR><BR>The Customer Success Professional's Handbook is the definitive reference book for CSMs and similar roles in the field. This practical, first-of-its-kind manual fills a significant gap in professional customer success literature, providing the knowledge every CSM needs to succeedâfrom the practitioner level all the way to senior leadership. The authorsâacknowledged experts in building, training, and managing Customer Success teamsâoffer real-world guidance and practical advice for aspiring and experienced CSMs alike. The handbook is written by practioners for practioners.

And it is not just technology every sector is undergoing a fundamental shift in consumer expectations. Customers and businesses are demanding a higher standard. In short, they are demanding customer success. <BR><BR>The Customer Success Manager (CSM) role is one of the fastest growing jobs as a result. This is a global trend that is unlikely to slow because instead of being content with purchasing a product and walking away, customers are purchasing and expecting results.

They capture customers' objectives, map out a pathway to achieving them, and measure success against those goals using sophisticated tools and data-based feedback. The Customer Success Professional's Handbook serves as an invaluable resource for anyone working or interested in this emerging function.

Here, on a scale unmatched by any previous collection, is the extraordinary energy and eloquence of our first national political campaign: During the secret proceedings of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the framers created a fundamentally new national plan to replace the Articles of Confederation and then submitted it to conventions in each state for ratification. Immediately, a fierce storm of argument broke. Federalist supporters, Antifederalist opponents, and seekers of a middle ground strove to balance public order and personal liberty as they praised, condemned, challenged, and analyzed the new Constitution Gathering hundreds of original texts by Franklin, Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and Patrick Henry--as well as many others less well known today--this unrivaled collection allows readers to experience firsthand the intense year-long struggle that created what remains the world's oldest working national charter.<BR><BR>Assembled here in chronological order are hundreds of newspaper articles, pamphlets, speeches, and private letters written or delivered in the aftermath of the Constitutional Convention. Along with familiar figures like Franklin, Madison, Patrick Henry, Jefferson, and Washington, scores of less famous citizens are represented, all speaking clearly and passionately about government. The most famous writings of the ratification struggle -- the Federalist essays of Hamilton and Madison -- are placed in their original context, alongside the arguments of able antagonists, such as "Brutus" and the "Federal Farmer."<BR><BR>Part Two gathers collected press polemics and private commentaries from January to August 1788, including all the amendments proposed by state ratifying conventions as well as dozens of speeches from the South Carolina, Virginia, New York, and North Carolina conventions. Included are dramatic confrontations from Virginia, where Patrick Henry pitted his legendary oratorical skills against the persuasive logic of Madison, and from New York, where Alexander Hamilton faced the brilliant Antifederalist Melancton Smith.<BR><BR>Informative notes, biographical profiles of all writers, speakers, and recipients, and a detailed chronology of relevant events from 1774 to 1804 provide fascinating background. A general index allows readers to follow specific topics, and an appendix includes the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution (with all amendments).<BR><BR>LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing.

That autumn, powerful arguments were made against the new charter by Virginian George Mason and the still-unidentified "Federal Farmer," while in New York newspapers, the Federalist essays initiated a brilliant defense. Dozens of speeches from the state ratifying conventions show how the "draft of a plan, nothing but a dead letter," in Madison's words, had "life and validity...breathed into it by the voice of the people." Included are the conventions in Pennsylvania, where James Wilson confronted the democratic skepticism of those representing the western frontier, and in Massachusetts, where John Hancock and Samuel Adams forged a crucial compromise that saved the country from years of political convulsion.<BR><BR>Informative notes, biographical profiles of all writers, speakers, and recipients, and a detailed chronology of relevant events from 1774 to 1804 provide fascinating background.

For the past 120 years, readers of English have known only a poor imitation of Jules Verne's classic French novel Vingt Mille Lieues Sous les Mers and consequently relegated the writer to the category of a "boy's author". Since 1873 the standard English version has been Lewis Mercier's mangled "translation," a work that's filled with errors, mistranslations, and bogus additions, and missing nearly a quarter of Verne's original text. <BR><BR>Now, thanks to the life-long efforts of two Verne scholars, the English-speaking world at last has access to a definitive translation, the only English version based solely on the level of literary artist and scientific visionary, a category he has always enjoyed in Europe and Russia. <BR><BR>Mercier's act of literary vandalism went unnoticed until 1965, when New York University English professor Walter Miller discovered the missing text and began the restoration of the Verne masterpiece. After nearly thirty years of work, including rigorous examinations of his translation by experts in marine technology and biology, Miller teamed that Frederick Paul Walter in 1992 to create this landmark scientific and literary achievement. <BR><BR>Restored to the volume along with the original woodcut illustrations are the entertaining and often prescient drams of Captain Nemo, widely considered the prototypical science-fiction character. In this novel alone Verne has anticipated submarine diving planes, scuba gear, underwater laboratories, and marine ecological disasters. He also inspired large-scale underwater mining and farming of flora and fauna, and electricity from thermoclines, all currently in development. <BR><BR>Restoration of these visionary ideas and some twenty-three percent of the original text is certain to elevate Verne's standing in American scientific and literary circles.

Synopsis:<BR><BR>From the award-winning translator of The Iliad and The Odyssey comes a brilliant new translation of Virgil's great epic<BR><BR>Fleeing the ashes of Troy, Aeneas, Achilles' mighty foe in the Iliad, begins an incredible journey to fulfill his destiny as the founder of Rome. His voyage will take him through stormy seas, entangle him in a tragic love affair, and lure him into the world of the dead itself--all the way tormented by the vengeful Juno, Queen of the Gods. Ultimately, he reaches the promised land of Italy where, after bloody battles and with high hopes, he founds what will become the Roman empire. An unsparing portrait of a man caught between love, duty, and fate, the Aeneid redefines passion, nobility, and courage for our times. Robert Fagles, whose acclaimed translations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey were welcomed as major publishing events, brings the Aeneid to a new generation of readers, retaining all of the gravitas and humanity of the original Latin as well as its powerful blend of poetry and myth. Featuring an illuminating introduction to Virgil's world by esteemed scholar Bernard Knox, this volume lends a vibrant new voice to one of the seminal literary achievements of the ancient world.<BR><BR>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.<BR><BR>From the Back Cover:<BR><BR>Praise for Robert Fagles's translation of the Odyssey: <BR>"Wonderfully readable . . . just the right blend of sophistication and roughness, it seems to me." <BR>Ted Hughes <BR><BR>"A memorable achievement . . . Mr. Fagles has been remarkably successful in finding a style that is of our time and yet timeless." <BR>Richard Jenkyns, The New York Times Book Review <BR><BR>"Remarkably seductive . . . In Fagles's hands, this perennial poem of adventure' is again a work of entertainment, of majesty and epic beauty great enough to stun the senses." <BR> The Philadelphia Inquirer

A sweeping cultural history of one of the most influential mathematical books ever written<BR><BR>Euclid's Elements of Geometry is one of the fountainheads of mathematicsâand of culture. Written around 300 BCE, it has traveled widely across the centuries, generating countless new ideas and inspiring such figures as Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Abraham Lincoln, and Albert Einstein. Encounters with Euclid tells the story of this incomparable mathematical masterpiece, taking readers from its origins in the ancient world to its continuing influence today.<BR><BR>In this lively and informative book, Benjamin Wardhaugh explains how Euclid's text journeyed from antiquity to the Renaissance, introducing some of the many readers, copyists, and editors who left their mark on the Elements before handing it on. He shows how some read the book as a work of philosophy, while others viewed it as a practical guide to life. He examines the many different contexts in which Euclid's book and his geometry were put to use, from the Neoplatonic school at Athens and the artisans' studios of medieval Baghdad to the Jesuit mission in China and the workshops of Restoration London. Wardhaugh shows how the Elements inspired ideas in theology, art, and music, and how the book has acquired new relevance to the strange geometries of dark matter and curved space.<BR><BR>Encounters with Euclid traces the life and afterlives of one of the most remarkable works of mathematics ever written, revealing its lasting role in the timeless search for order and reason in an unruly world.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"This is a wonderful book that illustrates the tremendous influence Euclid's Elements has had all over the world and in virtually every century since its composition. A very enjoyable read."âVictor J. Katz, coauthor of Taming the Unknown: A History of Algebra from Antiquity to the Early Twentieth Century<BR><BR>"Wardhaugh's beautifully written and wide-ranging book is full of charm and learning."âReviel Netz, author of Ludic Proof: Greek Mathematics and the Alexandrian Aesthetic<BR><BR>"An astonishingly readable and informative history of the greatest mathematical bestseller of all time, from ancient Greece to dark energy. The writing is vivid and the stories are gripping. Highly recommended!"âIan Stewart<BR><BR>"Benjamin Wardhaugh is an excellent storyteller and his collected short story approach to the history of The Elements works splendidly. . . . Simultaneously educational, entertaining and illuminating. . . . A highly desirable read for all those, both professional and amateur, who interest themselves in the histories of mathematics, science and knowledge."âThony Christie, Renaissance Mathematicus<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Benjamin Wardhaugh is a historian of mathematics. He is the author of Gunpowder and Geometry: The Life of Charles Hutton, Pit Boy, Mathematician, and Scientific Rebel and How to Read Historical Mathematics (Princeton) and the editor of A Wealth of Numbers: An Anthology of 500 Years of Popular Mathematics Writing (Princeton).

Fifty years ago, James D. Watson, then just twentyfour, helped launch the greatest ongoing scientific quest of our time. Now, with unique authority and sweeping vision, he gives us the first full account of the genetic revolution-from Mendel's garden to the double helix to the sequencing of the human genome and beyond.<BR>Watson's lively, panoramic narrative begins with the fanciful speculations of the ancients as to why "like begets like" before skipping ahead to 1866, when an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel first deduced the basic laws of inheritance. But genetics as we recognize it today-with its capacity, both thrilling and sobering, to manipulate the very essence of living things-came into being only with the rise of molecular investigations culminating in the breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA, for which Watson shared a Nobel prize in 1962. In the DNA molecule's graceful curves was the key to a whole new science.<BR><BR>Having shown that the secret of life is chemical, modern genetics has set mankind off on a journey unimaginable just a few decades ago. Watson provides the general reader with clear explanations of molecular processes and emerging technologies. He shows us how DNA continues to alter our understanding of human origins, and of our identities as groups and as individuals. And with the insight of one who has remained close to every advance in research since the double helix, he reveals how genetics has unleashed a wealth of possibilities to alter the human condition-from genetically modified foods to genetically modified babies-and transformed itself from a domain of pure research into one of big business as well. It is a sometimes topsy-turvy world full of great minds and great egos, driven by ambitions to improve the human condition as well as to improve investment portfolios, a world vividly captured in these pages.<BR><BR>Facing a future of choices and social and ethical implications of which we dare not remain uninformed, we could have no better guide than James Watson, who leads us with the same bravura storytelling that made The Double Helix one of the most successful books on science ever published. Infused with a scientist's awe at nature's marvels and a humanist's profound sympathies, DNA is destined to become the classic telling of the defining scientific saga of our age.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Amazon.com Review<BR>What makes DNA different from hordes of competitors purporting to help readers understand genetics is that it is written by none other than James Watson, of Watson and Crick fame. He and his co-author Andrew Berry have produced a clear and easygoing history of genetics, from Mendel through genome sequencing. Watson offers readers a sense of immediacy, a behind-the scenes familiarity with some of the most exciting developments in modern science. He gleefully reports on the research juggernaut that led to current obsessions with genetic engineering and cloning. Aided by profuse illustrations and photos, Watson offers an enthusiastic account of how scientists figured out how DNA codes for the creation of proteins--the so-called "central dogma" of genetics. But as patents and corporations enter the picture, Watson reveals his concern about the incursions of business into the hallowed halls of science.<BR><BR>After 1975, DNA was no longer solely the concern of academics trying to understand the molecular underpinnings of life. The molecule moved beyond the cloisters of white-coated scientists into a very different world populated largely by men in silk ties and sharp suits.<BR><BR>In later chapters, Watson aims barbs at those who are concerned by genetic tinkering, calling them "alarmists" who don't understand how the experiments work. It is in these arguments that Watson may lose favor with those whose notions of science were born after Silent Spring. Nevertheless, DNA encompasses both sides of the political issues involved in genetics, and Watson is an enthusiastic proponent of debate on the subject. The book accompanies a 5-part PBS series. --Therese Littleton <BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>Who better than James Watson to lead a guided tour of DNA? When he and his English colleague, Francis Crick, discovered the double helix structure of the DNA molecule in 1953, little could they imagine that a mere 50 years later scientists would be putting the finishing touches on a map of the human genome. In this magisterial work, Watson, who won the Nobel Prize with Crick for their discovery, guides readers through the startling and rapid advances in genetic technology and what these advances will mean for our lives. Watson covers all aspects of the genome, from the layout of four simple bases on the DNA molecule through their complex construction into genes, then to the mechanisms whereby proteins produced by genes create our uniquely human characteristics-as well as the genetic mutations that can cause illnesses or inherited diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Huntington's disease. Watson may have mellowed a little over the years since he displayed his youthful brashness in The Double Helix, but he still isn't shy about taking on controversial subjects. He criticizes biotech corporations for patenting genes, making diagnostic medical procedures horribly expensive and damping further basic research. He notes that while China and other countries with large populations to feed have eagerly grasped the potential of genetically modified foodstuffs, America squandered $100 million on a recall of taco shells and the genetically modified corn used in them. He pleads passionately for the refinement and widespread use of prenatal genetic testing. Watson will probably provoke the most controversy with his criticism of scientists, corporations and government funding sources for their avoidance of important areas of research-notably the genetics of skin coloration-for political reasons.

Catch him on the five-part PBS series in April or on the eight-city author tour. <BR>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>*Starred Review* Intended to enlighten those with "zero biological knowledge," this history of the genetics revolution coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of Watson and Francis Crick's coup in divining DNA's structure. A leader of the revolution as an administrator and public defender, Watson throughout the work addresses objections leveled at molecular manipulation. It's a fair-minded approach that fruitfully combines with Watson's clarity about the biochemistry underlying, for instance, the dread of genetically modified crops; if by his conclusion, a reader still adamantly opposes this or that technology, at least the stance won't be in the face of ignorance. Alongside this mission of enlightenment, Watson repeats a penchant for colorful characterization of rivals--perhaps the factor that made The Double Helix (1968) such a controversial classic. Previously caricatured, Rosalind Franklin now comes off more generously, Watson conceding that her work (vital to his and Crick's visualization of the double helix) justified a Nobel Prize had she not died tragically early. Nobel winners subsequently crowd Watson's narrative, accorded the laurels for their milestones in deducing pathways from DNA replication to protein production; in isolating individual genes; and in the invention of DNA amplification that makes fingerprinting and genome mapping possible. Whatever one's feelings about it, genetic engineering has rarely been as plainly explained as in this tremendously cogent tour d'horizon, a capstone worthy of Watson's career as a public scientist.

She was proud of her father's Scottish origins, and saw in him the traditional Scottish virtues of honesty, hard work, and thriftiness. She, too, possessed these qualities and felt that they must have been passed down to her from him. His tragic early death meant that her only nongenetic legacy was a set of tiny little girl's kilts he had ordered for her from Glasgow. Perhaps therefore it is not surprising that she valued her father's biological legacy over his material one.<BR><BR>Growing up, I had endless arguments with Mother about the relative roles played by nature and nurture in shaping us. By choosing nurture over nature, I was effectively subscribing to the belief that I could make myself into whatever I wanted to be. I did not want to accept that my genes mattered that much, preferring to attribute my Watson grandmother's extreme fatness to her having overeaten. If her shape was the product of her genes, then I too might have a hefty future. However, even as a teenager, I would not have disputed the evident basics of inheritance, that like begets like. My arguments with my mother concerned complex characteristics like aspects of personality, not the simple attributes that, even as an obstinate adolescent, I could see were passed down over the generations, resulting in "family likeness." My nose is my mother's and now belongs to my three sons.<BR><BR>Sometimes characteristics come and go within a few generations, but sometimes they persist over many. One of the most famous examples of a long-lived trait is known as the "Hapsburg Lip." This distinctive elongation of the jaw and droopiness to the lower lip-which made the Hapsburg rulers of Europe such a nightmare assignment for generations of court portrait painters-was passed down intact over at least twenty-three generations.<BR><BR>The Hapsburgs added to their genetic woes by intermarrying. Arranging marriages between different branches of the Hapsburg clan and often among close relatives may have made political sense as a way of building alliances and ensuring dynastic succession, but it was anything but astute in genetic terms. Inbreeding of this kind can result in genetic disease, as the Hapsburgs found out to their cost. Charles II, the last of the Hapsburg monarchs in Spain, not only boasted a prize-worthy example of the family lip-he could not even chew his own food-but was also a complete invalid, and incapable, despite two marriages, of producing children.<BR><BR>Genetic disease has long stalked humanity. In some cases, such as Charles II's, it has had a direct impact on history. Retrospective diagnosis has suggested that George III, the English king whose principal claim to fame is to have lost the American colonies in the Revolutionary War, suffered from an inherited disease, porphyria, which causes periodic bouts of madness. Some historians-mainly British ones-have argued that it was the distraction caused by George's illness that permitted the Americans' against-the-odds military success. While most hereditary diseases have no such geopolitical impact, they nevertheless have brutal and often tragic consequences for the afflicted families, sometimes for many generations. Understanding genetics is not just about understanding why we look like our parents. It is also about coming to grips with some of humankind's oldest enemies: the flaws in our genes that cause genetic disease.<BR><BR>our ancestors must have wondered about the workings of heredity as soon as evolution endowed them with brains capable of formulating the right kind of question. And the readily observable principle that close relatives tend to be similar can carry you a long way if, like our ancestors, your concern with the application of genetics is limited to practical matters like improving domesticated animals (for, say, milk yield in cattle) and plants (for, say, the size of fruit). Generations of careful selection-breeding initially to domesticate appropriate species, and then breeding only from the most productive cows and from the trees with the largest fruit-resulted in animals and plants tailor-made for human purposes. Underlying this enormous unrecorded effort is that simple rule of thumb: that the most productive cows will produce highly productive offspring and from the seeds of trees with large fruit large-fruited trees will grow. Thus, despite the extraordinary advances of the past hundred years or so, the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by no means have a monopoly on genetic insight. Although it wasn't until 1909 that the British biologist William Bateson gave the science of inheritance a name, genetics, and although the DNA revolution has opened up new and extraordinary vistas of potential progress, in fact the single greatest application of genetics to human well-being was carried out eons ago by anonymous ancient farmers. Almost everything we eat-cereals, fruit, meat, dairy products-is the legacy of that earliest and most far-reaching application of genetic manipulations to human problems.<BR><BR>An understanding of the actual mechanics of genetics proved a tougher nut to crack. Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) published his famous paper on the subject in 1866 (and it was ignored by the scientific community for another thirty-four years). Why did it take so long? After all, heredity is a major aspect of the natural world, and, more important, it is readily, and universally, observable: a dog owner sees how a cross between a brown and black dog turns out, and all parents consciously or subconsciously track the appearance of their own characteristics in their children. One simple reason is that genetic mechanisms turn out to be complicated. Mendel's solution to the problem is not intuitively obvious: children are not, after all, simply a blend of their parents' characteristics. Perhaps most important was the failure by early biologists to distinguish between two fundamentally different processes, heredity and development. Today we understand that a fertilized egg contains the genetic information, contributed by both parents, that determines whether someone will be afflicted with, say, porphyria. That is heredity. The subsequent process, the development of a new individual from that humble starting point of a single cell, the fertilized egg, involves implementing that information. Broken down in terms of academic disciplines, genetics focuses on the information and developmental biology focuses on the use of that information. Lumping heredity and development together into a single phenomenon, early scientists never asked the questions that might have steered them toward the secret of heredity. Nevertheless, the effort had been under way in some form since the dawn of Western history.<BR><BR>The Greeks, including Hippocrates, pondered heredity. They devised a theory of "pangenesis," which claimed that sex involved the transfer of miniaturized body parts: "Hairs, nails, veins, arteries, tendons and their bones, albeit invisible as their particles are so small. While growing, they gradually separate from each other." This idea enjoyed a brief renaissance when Charles Darwin, desperate to support his theory of evolution by natural selection with a viable hypothesis of inheritance, put forward a modified version of pangenesis in the second half of the nineteenth century. In Darwin's scheme, each organ-eyes, kidneys, bones-contributed circulating "gemmules" that accumulated in the sex organs, and were ultimately exchanged in the course of sexual reproduction. Because these gemmules were produced throughout an organism's lifetime, Darwin argued any change that occurred in the individual after birth, like the stretch of a giraffe's neck imparted by craning for the highest foliage, could be passed on to the next generation. Ironically, then, to buttress his theory of natural selection Darwin came to champion aspects of Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics-the very theory that his evolutionary ideas did so much to discredit. Darwin was invoking only Lamarck's theory of inheritance; he continued to believe that natural selection was the driving force behind evolution, but supposed that natural selection operated on the variation produced by pangenesis. Had Darwin known about Mendel's work (although Mendel published his results shortly after The Origin of Species appeared, Darwin was never aware of them), he might have been spared the embarrassment of this late-career endorsement of some of Lamarck's ideas.<BR><BR>Whereas pangenesis supposed that embryos were assembled from a set of minuscule components, another approach, "preformationism," avoided the assembly step altogether: either the egg or the sperm (exactly which was a contentious issue) contained a complete preformed individual called a homunculus. Development was therefore merely a matter of enlarging this into a fully formed being. In the days of preformationism, what we now recognize as genetic disease was variously interpreted: sometimes as a manifestation of the wrath of God or the mischief of demons and devils; sometimes as evidence of either an excess of or a deficit of the father's "seed"; sometimes as the result of "wicked thoughts" on the part of the mother during pregnancy. On the premise that fetal malformation can result when a pregnant mother's desires are thwarted, leaving her feeling stressed and frustrated, Napoleon passed a law permitting expectant mothers to shoplift. None of these notions, needless to say, did much to advance our understanding of genetic disease.<BR><BR>By the early nineteenth century, better microscopes had defeated preformationism. Look as hard as you like, you will never see a tiny homunculus curled up inside a sperm or egg cell. Pangenesis, though an earlier misconception, lasted rather longer-the argument would persist that the gemmules were simply too small to visualize-but was eventually laid to rest by August Weismann, who argued that inheritance depended on the continuity of germ pl...

Synopsis:<BR><BR>The classic personal account of Watson and Crick's groundbreaking discovery of the structure of DNA, now with an introduction by Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind.<BR><BR>By identifying the structure of DNA, the molecule of life, Francis Crick and James Watson revolutionized biochemistry and won themselves a Nobel Prize. At the time, Watson was only twenty-four, a young scientist hungry to make his mark. His uncompromisingly honest account of the heady days of their thrilling sprint against other world-class researchers to solve one of science's greatest mysteries gives a dazzlingly clear picture of a world of brilliant scientists with great gifts, very human ambitions, and bitter rivalries.<BR><BR>With humility unspoiled by false modesty, Watson relates his and Crick's desperate efforts to beat Linus Pauling to the Holy Grail of life sciences, the identification of the basic building block of life. Never has a scientist been so truthful in capturing in words the flavor of his work.<BR><BR>Review:<BR><BR>"Science seldom proceeds in the straightforward logical manner imagined by outsiders," writes James Watson in The Double Helix, his account of his codiscovery (along with Francis Crick) of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick won Nobel Prizes for their work, and their names are memorized by biology students around the world. But as in all of history, the real story behind the deceptively simple outcome was messy, intense, and sometimes truly hilarious. To preserve the "real" story for the world, James Watson attempted to record his first impressions as soon after the events of 1951-1953 as possible, with all their unpleasant realities and "spirit of adventure" intact.<BR><BR>Watson holds nothing back when revealing the petty sniping and backbiting among his colleagues, while acknowledging that he himself was a willing participant in the melodrama. In particular, Watson reveals his mixed feelings about his famous colleague in discovery, Francis Crick, who many thought of as an arrogant man who talked too much, and whose brilliance was appreciated by few. This is the joy of The Double Helix--instead of a chronicle of stainless-steel heroes toiling away in their sparkling labs, Watson's chronicle gives readers an idea of what living science is like, warts and all. The Double Helix is a startling window into the scientific method, full of insight and wit, and packed with the kind of science anecdotes that are told and retold in the halls of universities and laboratories everywhere. It's the stuff of legends. --Therese Littleton

How the "First State" has enabled international crime, sheltered tax dodgers, and diverted hard-earned dollars from the rest of us<BR><BR>The legal home to over a million companies, Delaware has more registered businesses than residents. Why do virtually all of the biggest corporations in the United States register there? Why do so many small companies choose to set up in Delaware rather than their home states? Why do wealthy individuals form multiple layers of private companies in the state? This book reveals how a systematic enterprise lies behind the business-friendly corporate veneer, one that has kept the state afloat financially by diverting public funds away from some of the poorest people in the United States and supporting dictators and criminals across the world.<BR><BR>Hal Weitzman shows how the de facto capital of corporate America has provided safe haven to money launderers, kleptocratic foreign rulers, and human traffickers, and facilitated tax dodging and money laundering by multinational companies and international gangsters. Revenues from Delaware's business-formation industry, known as the Franchise, account for two-fifths of the state's budget and have helped to keep the tax burden on its residents among the lowest in the United States. Delaware derives enormous political clout from the Franchise, effectively writing the corporate code for the entire countryâand because of its outsized influence on corporate America, the second smallest state in the United States also writes the rules for much of the world.<BR><BR>What's the Matter with Delaware? shows how, in Joe Biden's home state, the corporate laws get written behind closed doors, enabling the rich and powerful to do business in the shadows.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"One of The Economist's Best Books to Read to Understand Financial Crime"<BR><BR>"[An] entertaining exploration. . . . [Weitzman] takes up a dry topic and breathes life into it."---Alan Livsey, Financial Times<BR><BR>"I can't recommend this book enough."---Emma Vigeland, The Majority Report podcast<BR><BR>Review<BR>"What is it that attracts giant multinational companies, kleptocrats, and tax evaders to Delaware? In this eye-opening book, Weitzman unveils the central role played by the First Stateâthis great cog of American capitalismâin the financial dealings of big companies and wealthy families. This is a must-read book for anyone who cares about the future of taxation and inequality."âGabriel Zucman, coauthor of The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay<BR><BR>"This book is a meticulously researched and powerfully argued examination of capitalism's 'Delaware problem,' which undermines the transparency and accountability essential to a strong economy. A must-read for anyone who wants to know why it is so difficult to align corporate action with shareholder value or the public interest."âNell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors<BR><BR>"Enlivened by rich anecdotes and stories, this book is a devastating attack on Delaware's dominance. Weitzman shows how its supremacy in the nation's economic life creates profound injury to other states, real humans both near and far, and indeed democracy itself."âKent Greenfield, Boston College Law School<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Hal Weitzman is executive director for intellectual capital at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and editor-in-chief of Chicago Booth Review.

Together in one indispensable volume, The Time Machine and The Invisible Man are masterpieces of irony and imaginative vision from H. G. Wells, the father of science fiction.<BR><BR>The Time Machine conveys the Time Traveller into the distant future and an extraordinary world.

A cautionary tale of the horrors that can ensue when man experiments with nature, from the father of science fiction, H.G. Wells. <BR><BR>A lonely island in the Pacific. The sinister scientist who rules it. And the strange beings who dwell there...<BR><BR>This is the scenario for H. G. Wells's haunting classic, one of his most intriguing and visionary novels. Living in the late nineteenth century and facing the impact of Darwin's theory of evolution, Wells wrote this chilling masterpiece about the characteristics of beasts blurring as the animals turn into men. Dr. Moreau, a scientist expelled from his homeland for his cruel vivisection experiments, finds a deserted island that gives him the freedom to continue torturous transplantations and create hideous creatures with manlike intelligence. But as the brutally enforced order on Moreau's island dissolves, the true consequences of his experiments emerge, and his creations revert to beasts more shocking than nature could devise.<BR><BR>A genius of his time, H. G. Wells foresaw the use of what he called the "atom bomb," the practice of gene-splicing, and men landing on the moon. Now, when these have become part of everyday life, his dark fable serves as a compelling reminder of the horrors that reckless experiments with nature can produce.<BR><BR>With an Introduction by Nita A. Farahany <BR>and an Afterword by Dr. John L. Flynn

The history of American oratory exhibits, in the words of William F. Buckley, "powerful ignition points for hot flashes of indignation, contempt, rage, veneration and yearning." This volume (the second of an unprecedented two-volume collection) gathers the unabridged texts of 83 eloquent and dramatic speeches delivered by 45 American public figures between 1865 and 1997, beginning with Abraham Lincoln's last speech on Reconstruction and ending with Bill Clinton's heartfelt tribute to the Little Rock Nine. During this period American political oratory continued to evolve, as a more conversational style, influenced by the intimacy of radio and television, emerged alongside traditional forms of rhetoric.<BR><BR>Included are speeches on Reconstruction by Thaddeus Stevens and African-American congressman Robert Brown Elliott, Frederick Douglass's brilliant oration on Abraham Lincoln, and Oliver Wendell Holmes's "touched with fire" Memorial Day Address. Speeches by Robert Ingersoll and William Jennings Bryan capture the fervor of 19th-century political conventions, while Theodore Roosevelt and Carl Schurz offer opposing views on imperialism. Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell denounce the cruelty of lynching and the injustice of Jim Crow; Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Carrie Chapman Catt advocate the enfranchisement of women; and Woodrow Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge present conflicting visions of the League of Nations.<BR><BR>Also included are wartime speeches by George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower; an address on the atomic bomb by J. Robert Oppenheimer; Richard Nixon's "Checkers Speech;" Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet;" Barry Goldwater's speech to the 1964 Republican convention; Mario Savio urging Berkeley students to stop "the machine;" Barbara Jordan defending the Constitution during Watergate; and an extensive selection of speeches by Franklin Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, John F.

In this personal book from the star of many beloved and classic film comedies -- from The Producers to Young Frankenstein, Blazing saddles to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory -- Gene Wilder writes about a side of his life the public hasn't seen on the screen. Kiss Me Like a Stranger is not an autobiography in the usual sense of the word, and it's certainly not another celebrity "tell-all." Instead, Wilder has chosen to write about resonant moments in his life, events that led him to an understanding of the art of acting, and -- more important -- to an understanding of how to give love to and receive love from a woman.<BR><BR>Wilder writes compellingly about the creative process on stage and screen, and divulges moments from life on the sets of some of the most iconic movies of our time.<BR><BR>In this book, he talks about everything from his experiences in psychoanalysis to why he got into acting and later comedy (his first goal was to be a Shakespearean actor), and how a Midwestern childhood with a sick mother changed him. Wilder explains why he became an actor and writer, and about the funny, wonderful movies he made with Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, and Harrison Ford, among many others. He candidly reveals his failures in love, and writes about the overwhelming experience of marrying comedienne Gilda Radner, as well as what finally had to happen for him to make a true and lasting commitment to another woman.<BR><BR>A thoughtful, revealing, and winsome book about life, love, and the creative process, Kiss Me Like A Stranger is one actor's life in his own words.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From Publishers Weekly<BR>The man who created some of the funniest moments in film history talks about acting, adultery, neuroses and death in this intimate, unusual memoir. Wilder began acting as a teenager at summer camp and eventually earned some acclaim on Broadway but not much money - he says he was still collecting unemployment checks when he began shooting his breakout film role in Mel Brooks's original film version of The Producers (1968). The movie flopped commercially, but Wilder's comedic chops were established. A string of successes followed: Blazing Saddles; Young Frankenstein; Willy Wonka; Stir Crazy. Off camera, things were more complicated. After two troubled marriages, Wilder married Saturday Night Live's Gilda Radner - a brilliant, erratic woman who battled bulimia and wild mood swings. Wilder is unusually frank in documenting both Radner's faults and her long struggle with cancer. Honesty is a prevailing quality of this book, as Wilder freely discusses topics ranging from his own neuroses to the drug-fueled misbehavior of his great comedic partner, Richard Pryor. He also doesn't avoid telling the details of his own bout with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Wilder's fans may be disappointed to find relatively scant coverage of some of his triumphs, but Wilder clearly isn't interested in writing a conventional Hollywood memoir. His book candidly explores his own faults and feelings, as well as those of the people he's loved and lost. Photos. <BR>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.<BR><BR>From Booklist<BR>Readers looking for a little comic relief will be disappointed by this thoughtfully serious memoir. Like that of many comics, Wilder's private life does not reflect his zany stage and screen persona. Introspective by nature, he provides a series of vignettes that he hopes will add clarity to his personal search for the truth about his family, his loves, the choices he has made, and his quest for artistic fulfillment. Unflinching in their honesty, these snippets constitute a revealing overview of an intriguing life. Wilder's formative relationship with his sick mother, his personal and professional associations with Richard Pryor and Mel Brooks, his complex marriage to the late Gilda Radner, and his attempts to make sense of it all through intense psychotherapy make fascinating reading. Framed like individual scenes from a movie, these recollections add up to a compelling portrait of a multifaceted man. Margaret Flanagan<BR>Copyright © American Library Association. All rights reserved<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Pure Gene Wilder! Uproarishly funny and at times very moving. It made me want to go out and see every Gene Wilder movie again." -- Mel Brooks<BR><BR>"I always knew Gene Wilder was a remarkable person, but I didn't know how remarkable until I read this brave, riveting book." -- Charles Grodin<BR><BR>"Gene Wilder is not just a uniquely talented and lovable performer, he's a gifted memoirist with a great story to tell and a writerly commitment to emotional truth. The real delight lies in the prose -- tight, funny, fast as the breeze -- and insights about accident and fate that lodge in your mind long after the smile has left your lips." -- Letty Cottin Pogrebin, author of Three Daughters<BR><BR>"A book to cherish. Here is the real Gene...irrepressibly funny, wise, warmhearted, and honest. In sharing with us the most intimate details of his extraordinary life on screen and off, Gene shows all if us how to embrace the unexpected, pursue our passion, and seize joy every day. Give this book to someone you want to kiss." -- Pat Collins, film critic<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Gene Wilder has been acting since he was thirteen. After a small role in Bonnie and Clyde pulled him away from a career onstage, he was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role as Leo Bloom in The Producers, which led to Blazing Saddles and then to another Academy nomination, this time for writing Young Frankenstein. Wilder has appeared in twenty-five feature films and a number of stage productions. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, Karen.

For years I have been writing short stories in secret. Slipping away into my own little worlds that I create. After decades of wondering if I was even a good writer or not, I decided I'd just finally put the stories out there and let you, the reader, decide. I write for my own enjoyment and if what I write brings something to you, then that makes me happy as well. My stories may surprise you as they delve into some of the darker and more serious themes of life versus the comedic tones I am best known for. My stories run the gamut from fiction to horror, romance to sci-fi, absurd to erotic. I love to write in as many varied genres as my imagination will take me. In fact, most of the time I don't even know what I'm writing next, my mind just takes me there. I plan out very little of my stories, allowing my mind to pull me along and reveal the words to me as I go. As if I'm being told a story myself as opposed to writing one. It's quite thrilling for me. If you feel adventurous please have a read, and I hope you find something in my stories that evokes feelings and emotions for you. Enjoy!

Texas history buffs and travelers have an eerie need for this book, which offers an unusual twist to seeing the "sights" in the Lone Star state. Organized by regionâGulf Coast, Rio Grande Valley, South Texas, Central Texas, North Texas, and West Texasâthis book is the complete guide for both hardcore ghost hunters and more earthly tourists seeking to add some spirited fun to their travels. Complete practical information on non-haunted accommodations, attractions, and restaurants are also included, making this the only guide your Texan spirit will need. <BR><BR>Scott Williams, who lives in Corpus Christi, is a journalist and the author also of The Insiders' Guide to Corpus Christi.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>From the Back Cover<BR>Reading line: Tales of ghostly goings-on and spooky sightings in the Lone Star State<BR><BR>From its dusty, windswept Panhandle to the long, sandy shores along the Gulf of Mexico, Texas is best known for miles-wide cattle ranches, fields of oil derricks, vibrant country-and-western music, and hard-to-beat Tex-Mex. It's also a big state full of tall tales, legendary figures, historic battles, and plenty of places where you can learn about--or even relive--some of its long, colorful history. In fact, some Texans are convinced that many of its long-lost residents are not so much lost in history as trapped in an eternal present, destined forever to haunt the state's cemeteries, back roads, battlegrounds, and even hotels and restaurants. <BR>One old bridge outside of Denton is said to be haunted by the ghost of a man who was lynched one night by a mob, though the noose turned up empty and his body was never found. The staff of a former Carnegie library in downtown Houston sometimes report hearing a violin playing in the building--apparently the resident custodian who died there in 1936 still enjoys performing from time to time. In August 1951, Lubbock became known for the one of the most famous UFO sightings in U.S. history. And more than one back road in rural Texas is the place to visit at night for those who want to see mysterious floating lights.<BR>Scott Williams is the co-author of The Insiders' Guide to Corpus Christi. He is a full-time freelance writer who has spent the past two decades as a reporter and writer for newspapers, magazines, websites, and book publishers.

From Jocko Wilnick, the New York Times best selling author of Discipline Equals Freedom and Leadership Strategy and Tactics, an updated edition of the blockbuster bestselling leadership book that took America and the world by storm, two U.S. Navy SEAL officers who led the most highly decorated special forces unit of the Iraq War demonstrate how to apply powerful leadership principles from the battlefield to business and life. Now with an excerpt from the authors' new book, THE DICHOTOMY OF LEADERSHIP. <BR><BR>Combat, the most intense and dynamic environment imaginable, teaches the toughest leadership lessons, with absolutely everything at stake. Jocko Willink and Leif Babin learned this reality first-hand on the most violent and dangerous battlefield in Iraq. As leaders of SEAL Team Three's Task Unit Bruiser, their mission was one many thought impossible: help U.S. forces secure Ramadi, a violent, insurgent-held city deemed "all but lost." In gripping, firsthand accounts of heroism, tragic loss, and hard-won victories, they learned that leadership-at every level-is the most important factor in whether a team succeeds or fails. <BR><BR>Willink and Babin returned home from deployment and instituted SEAL leadership training to pass on their harsh lessons of self-discipline, mental toughness and self-defense learned in combat to help forge the next generation of SEAL leaders. After leaving the SEAL Teams, they launched a company, Echelon Front, to teach those same leadership principles to leaders in businesses, companies, and organizations across the civilian sector. Since that time, they have trained countless leaders and worked with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry across the U.S. and internationally, teaching them how to develop their own high-performance teams and most effectively lead those teams to dominate their battlefields.<BR><BR>Since it's release in October 2015, Extreme Ownership has revolutionized leadership development and set a new standard for literature on the subject. Required reading for many of the most successful organizations, it has become an integral part of the official leadership training programs for scores of business teams, military units, and first responders. Detailing the resilient mindset and total focus principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult combat missions, Extreme Ownership demonstrates how to apply them to any team or organization, in any leadership environment. A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme Ownership challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.

From "America's nerviest journalist" (Newsweek)-a breath-taking epic, a magnificent adventure story, and an investigation into the true heroism and courage of the first Americans to conquer space. "Tom Wolfe at his very best" (The New York Times Book Review)<BR><BR>Millions of words have poured forth about man's trip to the moon, but until now few people have had a sense of the most engrossing side of the adventure; namely, what went on in the minds of the astronauts themselves - in space, on the moon, and even during certain odysseys on earth. It is this, the inner life of the astronauts, that Tom Wolfe describes with his almost uncanny empathetic powers, that made The Right Stuff a classic.

A landmark of literary recovery: the first major edition of an overlooked genius who in her lifetime was considered 19th-centuryÂ America's greatest woman writerÂ <BR><BR>In the eyes of her contemporaries, Constance Fenimore Woolson (1840-1894) ranked with George Eliot as one of the two greatest women writers of the English language. She wrote fiction of remarkable intellectual power that outsold those of her male contemporaries Henry James and Willian Dean Howells. James enshrined memories of his long, complicated friendship with Woolson in The Beast in the Jungle and The Wings of the Dove, and more recently Colm Tobin treated the relationship in his novel The Master. But Woolson's close association with James, and her likely suicide in Venice, have tended to overshadow her own literary accomplishments, pigeonholing her as a martyr to the male literary establishment. This volume, the most comprehensive gathering of Woolson's stories to date, represents the culmination of decades of recovery work done by scholars, and puts the focus back on the work, where it belongs.<BR><BR>Set variously in the Great Lakes region, the post-Civil War South, and Europe, Woolson's short stories often concern outsiders of one kind or another--prophets and misfits living in remote landscapes, uneducated coal miners, impoverished spinsters, neglected nuns, a haunted caretaker of the dead, destitute southerners, and female artists driven to extreme behavior as they seek the admiration or approval of established (male) critics or writers. Woolson's minute realism captures both the social texture of her time and the inner emotional lives of these overlooked and marginalized characters. Most of all her writings startle us with their simmering intensity, their sensual descriptions of the environment, and refusal to smooth out the ambiguities and tensions that inevitably result from human efforts to communicate and connect. Her fiction is deeply human, resonating with a power across the centuries that makes them remarkably modern for today's readers.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"Woolson is one of those great ignored American writers, a writer of amazing stories that have a lucid spark and a keen wit. She was serious, and worthy of being considered along with James and William Dean Howells -- though she was a lot more fun." --The Arkansas Democrat Gazette<BR><BR>"[E]ven after a generation of recovery [Woolson's] life remains better known than her work. The twenty-three stories collected in this volume should change that. . . ." --Micahel Gorra, The New York Review of Books <BR>Â <BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Constance Fenimore Woolson (1840-1894) is the author of six novels: The Old Stone House (1873), Anne (1882), For the Major (1883), East Angels (1886), Jupiter Lights (1889), and Horace Chase (1894). In her lifetime, two collections of her stories appeared: Castle Nowhere: Lake-Country Sketches (1875) and Rodman the Keeper: Southern Sketches (1880). Two more collections were published after her death, The Front Yard and Other Italian Stories (1895) and Dorothy and Other Italian Stories (1896).<BR><BR>Anne Boyd Rioux is a Professor of English at the University of New Orleans, President of the Constance Fenimore Woolson Society, and the author of three books: Writing for Immortality: Women and the Emergence of High Literary Culture in America (2004), Constance Fenimore Woolson: Portrait of a Lady Novelist (2016), and Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy: The Story of Little Women and Why It Sill Matters (2018).

A spot-on guide to how and why Americans have become so bloody keen on Britishisms--for good or ill<BR><BR>The British love to complain that words and phrases imported from America--from French fries to Awesome, man!--are destroying the English language. But what about the influence going the other way? Britishisms have been making their way into the American lexicon for more than 150 years, but the process has accelerated since the turn of the twenty-first century. From acclaimed writer and language commentator Ben Yagoda, Gobsmacked! is a witty, entertaining, and enlightening account of how and why scores of British words and phrases--such as one-off, go missing, curate, early days, kerfuffle, easy peasy, and cheeky--have been enthusiastically taken up by Yanks.<BR><BR>After tracing Britishisms that entered the American vocabulary in the nineteenth century and during the world wars, Gobsmacked! discusses the most-used British terms in America today. It features chapters on the American embrace of British insults and curses, sports terms, and words about food and drinks. The book also explores the American adoption of British spellings, pronunciations, and grammar, and cases where Americans have misconstrued British expressions (for example, changing can't be arsed to can't be asked) or adopted faux-British usages, like pronouncing divisive as "divissive." Finally, the book offers some guidance on just how many Britishisms an American can safely adopt without coming off like an arse.<BR><BR>Rigorously researched and documented but written in a light, conversational style, this is a book that general readers and language obsessives will love. Its revealing account of a surprising and underrecognized language revolution might even leave them, well, gobsmacked.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR>"An Economist Best Book of the Year"<BR><BR>"The wash of cultural globalization, where everything is available all the time, has made it easier for words to flow into as well as out of the American word hoard. . . . Gobsmacked! is a collection of the hundred or so wittiest and most interesting entries from [Yagoda's blog] -- kerfuffle, pillock, twee, nonstarter and, of course, gobsmacked."---Dennis Duncan, Washington Post<BR><BR>"It is possible that the British need 'Gobsmacked!' more than their American cousins. The Americanisation of British English is well known; the Britishisation of American English, not so much...A country not sure what influence it still does--or should--have in the world might like to know that the superpower across the ocean still fancies the mother country and its culture." â The Economist<BR><BR>"Part of this book's delight is that it's not just about language--it's about Yagoda's research, resourcefulness, and diligence. . . . In Gobsmacked! Yagoda has written a fun, informative exploration of our language."---Christopher J. Scalia, Washington Free Beacon<BR><BR>Review<BR>"One could do worse than to have a lie-in with this valuable and entertaining book, in which Ben Yagoda gets his Britishisms sorted for our benefit. Brilliant, in the best American sense!"--Mary Norris, author of the New York Times bestselling Between You & Me: Confessions of a Comma Queen<BR><BR>"The best exploration of British and American lexical variation and change that I've ever read. Or, to put it in the terms of this book: it's brilliant, gobstoppingly spot-on, streets ahead of anything else."--David Crystal, author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language<BR><BR>"Ben Yagoda is one of our most insightful and entertaining commentators on language and culture. In Gobsmacked!, he focuses his formidable talents on an original and fascinating story: Britain's growing influence on U.S. speech. If you've ever wondered why you have suddenly started saying things like cheeky, dodgy, or twee, you'd be bonkers not to devour this wonderful book."--Fred R. Shapiro, editor of The New Yale Book of Quotations<BR><BR>"Despite my decades of experience with English on both sides of the Atlantic, and all my academic study of its varieties, Ben Yagoda's delightful book taught me things I had not yet realized about the British influence on American speech. As anyone acquainted with Yagoda's writing might expect, his book is both fascinating and fun."--Geoffrey K. Pullum, University of Edinburgh<BR><BR>About the Author<BR>Ben Yagoda has published more than a dozen books, including Will Rogers: A Biography; About Town: "The New Yorker" and the World It Made; When You Catch an Adjective, Kill It: The Parts of Speech, for Better and/or Worse; and The Sound on the Page: Style and Voice in Writing. He is professor emeritus of English at the University of Delaware. His blog, Not One-Off Britishisms, has been visited more than 3 million times.

The author of the Wall Street Journal bestseller Ultralearning explores why it's so difficult for people to learn new skills, arguing that three factors must be met to make advancement possible, and offering 12 maxims to improve the way we learn.<BR><BR>Life revolves around learning--in school, at our jobs, even in the things we do for fun. Yet learning is often mysterious. Sometimes it comes fairly effortlessly: quickly finding our way around a new neighborhood or picking up the routine at a new job. In other cases, it's a slog. We may spend hours in the library, yet still not do well on an exam. We may want to switch companies, industries, or even professions, but not feel qualified to make the leap. Decades spent driving a car, typing on a computer, or hitting a tennis ball don't reliably make us much better at them. Improvement can be fickle, if it comes at all.<BR><BR>In Get Better At Anything, Scott Young argues that there are three key factors in helping us learn:<BR><BR>See--Most of what we know comes from other people. The ease of learning from others determines, to a large extent, how quickly we can improve.<BR><BR>Do--Mastery requires practice. But not just any practice will do. Our brains are fantastic effort-saving machines, which can be both a tremendous advantage and a curse.<BR><BR>Feedback--Progress requires constant adjustment. Not just the red stroke of a teacher's pen, but the results of hands-on experience.<BR><BR>When we're able to learn from the example of other people, practice extensively ourselves, and get reliable feedback, rapid progress results. Yet, when one, or all, of these factors is inhibited, improvement often becomes impossible. Using research and real-life examples, Young breaks down these elements into twelve simple maxims. Whether you're a student studying for an exam, an employee facing a new skill at work, or just want to get better at something you're interested in, his insights will help you do it better.<BR><BR>Editorial Reviews<BR><BR>Review<BR><BR>"Scott H. Young knocks it out of the park withÂ Get Better at Anything. This concise guide will help, no matter what you are learning--or teaching!" -- Barbara Oakley, author of A Mind for NumbersÂ and instructor ofÂ Learning How to Learn, one of the world's most popular online courses<BR><BR>"The ability to efficiently learn hard things is like a superpower. In this phenomenally wise book, Scott H. Young revealsÂ exactly how to obtainÂ it!" -- Cal Newport,Â New York TimesÂ bestselling author ofÂ Digital MinimalismÂ andÂ Deep Work<BR><BR>"Get Better at Anything is a master class in accelerated, effective learning. Learning grounded in seeing how others are succeeding; experimenting with and testing new ideas in the real world; and, most important, being open and receptive to the feedback that inevitably comes back. Almost everything we do depends on learning new skills, new attitudes, and new behaviors--this book is an indispensable guide to mastering that skillÂ for a twenty-first century rocked by change and uncertainty." -- Tiago Forte, author ofÂ Building a Second Brain<BR><BR>"Full of fascinating insights and practical tips. Scott H. Young has written an excellent guide to getting better at getting better." -- Brad Stulberg, author of Master of Change and The Practice of Groundedness<BR><BR>"By far the best book on learning available today. The best method by the leading expert. Actionable, intriguing, inspiring. Read it now before learning more, to be supereffective." -- Derek Sivers, author of How to Live and Anything You Want<BR><BR>"Young breaks down the science of learning into actionable advice.

"Through my own experience with the Brethren, I can say they are the ideal place where a lay theologian can serve the Church with his gifts" (Restrospect, p. 285). <BR><BR>As a lover of the Biblie and of the classical languages, when he was only 10 years old, he started simultaneous studies in Greek and Latin. F.F. was admitted to Aberdeen University in October 1928. He studied also in University of Cambridge (England, 1932-34) and in the University of Vienna (Austria, 1934-35), studying in preparation for his Graduation and Doctoral degree, excelling in both. <BR><BR>Bruce taught Greek in the Universities of Edinburgh (1935-38) and Leeds (1938-47). Afterwards, he taught Bible History and Literature in the University of Sheffield (1947-59) followed by Bible Criticism and Exegesis in the University of Manchester (1959-78). <BR><BR>He lectured in prestigious universities all around the world: Marburg (Germany), Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Auckland (New Zealand), and Makerere (Uganda). He also lectured in numerous Theological Seminaries, among them the Calvin Seminary, in Grand Rapids (U.S.A.) and the Union Seminary, in New York City (U.S.A.). <BR><BR>He was voted President by the prestigious Societies of Old Testament Studies and New Testament Studies. <BR><BR>F.F. Bruce wrote some 50 books, plus several thousand articles, essays and reviews. His masterpiece The Acts of the Apostles: The Greek Text with Introduction and Commentary (1951) marked for the evangelical world the beginning of a new era in Bible study, being seriously considered by the Academia. In spite of never having made formal studies in Theology, he was an extraordinary reader of the subject and the Aberdeen University granted him in 1957 a Doctor Honoris Causa degree in Divinities.
